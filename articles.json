    "content": "Trump's state visit is mired with potential pitfalls despite careful planning6 hours agoShareSaveJames LandaleDiplomatic correspondentShareSaveBBCUS President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom this week will be no stranger to controversy, just as his first was six years ago.Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan \"a stone-cold loser\", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks.All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby.This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesTrump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019)There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.How Windsor became 'Trumpton'For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor \"Trumpton\", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show.Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty ImagesDetailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speechFor Palace officials, attention to detail is all.One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry.It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle.There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall.\"The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,\" said one royal insider. \"A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another.\"Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty ImagesOne challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve \"lots of nods to his Scottish heritage\".King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines.Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech.'Pressure to make this massive'So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task.The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf.\"There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,\" one courtier told me.Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty ImagesPresident Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and ThursdayThe scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.)For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows.One Whitehall source said: \"The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV.\"Another said: \"It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason.\"Peter Nicholls/Getty ImagesMembers of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guestsLord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world \"the fullest honour British protocol allows\" will be watched closely by the rest of the world.\"This state visit is not just a UK-US event,\" he said. \"It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. \"The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing.\"Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed.They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesPresident Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit\"Trump can be quite funny in private,\" said one diplomat. \"He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate.\"For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain.Serious business behind the pageantryBeyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers.Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation.The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing.This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as \"my personal pride and joy\", that he claimed would \"help write the next chapter of the special relationship\".All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic \"wins\" to help promote the government's growth agenda.Carl Court - Pool/Getty ImagesMinisters hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffsThe visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine.Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking.\"Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,\" Hunt said.\"What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil.\"Leon Neal/Getty ImagesPlanning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steelSophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China.\"We are moving into a new phase,\" she said. \"This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States.\"The Mandelson questionFor all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson.The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future.Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when?Carl Court/Getty ImagesThe PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack himSome diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position.But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him.According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial.Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesLord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and VanceDiplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit.Profound differences in the UK and USThe Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: \"On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China.\"The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two.\"Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East.Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called \"two state solution\". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment \"to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism\".Getty ImagesProtests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump BabyThere are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships.Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy.The diplomatic game of cardsAmid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes?\"The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,\" said one royal source. \"They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty ImagesThere have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019\"The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government.\"Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter.But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. \"This is very early in Trump's presidency,\" one diplomat said.\"Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?\"More from InDepthWith Trump's state visit days away, blame game begins over Mandelson scandalTrump is used to shaking off criticism - but the Epstein story is differentUS farmers are being squeezed - and it's testing their deep loyalty to TrumpTop picture credits: Win McNamee/Getty Images, Neil Hall /EPA/Shutterstock and Hollie Adams, WPA Pool/Getty Images, Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "content": "Google owner reveals £5bn AI investment in UK ahead of Trump visit1 hour agoShareSaveFaisal IslamEconomics editorShareSaveWatch: BBC speaks to Ruth Porat about AI investment in the UKThe world's fourth-biggest company, Google-owner Alphabet, has announced a  £5bn ($6.8bn) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI).The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit.Google's President and Chief Investment Officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were \"profound opportunities in the UK\" for its \"pioneering work in advanced science\".The company will officially open a vast $1bn (£735m) data centre in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves on Tuesday.The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research.Ms Porat said there was \"now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science\".She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said \"there's still work to be done to land that\", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom \"was not a foregone conclusion\".Getty ImagesGoogle's owner Alphabet has become the fourth company to be worth more than $3tn in terms of total stock market valueThe US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements.Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours.The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment.Yesterday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3tn in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Meta.Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company.Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an \"AI First\" business, saying \"it's that performance which has resulted in that metric\", Ms Porat said.Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models.Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres.Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat \"captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes\".Google signed a deal with Shell to supply \"95% carbon-free energy\" for its UK investments.In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources.Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building our renewable energy, but \"obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day\".Energy efficiency was being built into \"all aspects of AI\" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to \"modernise the grid\" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said.Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was \"spending a lot of time\" focused on the AI jobs challenge. \"It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside... If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy.\"But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: \"AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them.\"\"Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines,\" she said.AlphabetGoogleArtificial intelligenceDonald Trump"

    "content": "Mason: Reform UK amplifies existing jitters for Labour and Conservatives4 hours agoShareSaveChris MasonPolitical editorShareSaveBBCPeople I speak to at the top of government acknowledge the last few weeks have been dreadful for them and they are kicking themselves about the mistakes they have made.The latest twist, the departure of another senior aide to the prime minister, after the leaking of sexually explicit messages from nearly a decade ago, is seen by some in government as symptomatic of the factional acrimony reverberating through Labour.But there is something else going on here which amplifies the jitters within Labour and causes contortions and anguish for others here at Westminster.You can sum it up in a word: Reform.They are frightening their rivals right now.Their comfortable and now sustained over months lead in the opinion polls, alongside their habit of demonstrating momentum – the defection of Conservative shadow minister Danny Kruger being the latest case in point - is accelerating the difficult questions and conundrums the other parties wrestle with.For Labour, the fear that runs to their bones is bequeathing power to an outfit they loathe, Reform UK.For the Conservatives, frequently leaking defectors to Nigel Farage, every one sharpens the existential questions they confront.And for the Liberal Democrats, they have a record breaking 72 MPs but are frustrated at a perceived lack of attention, amid the din elsewhere.Reform UK's rise in London 'a threat to main parties'Those close to the prime minister are candid about how rough things have been for them and the task they have winning back the trust of so many of their MPs.\"We're not oblivious to the scale of the problem. We were aware of it before the summer, but the last two weeks have made it more difficult,\" is how one senior figure put it.Another senior figure tells me Sir Keir Starmer's speech to the Labour Party Conference in a fortnight's time \"will leave people in absolutely no doubt at all what he stands for and what the government stands for\".That, in itself, is a tacit acknowledgement that from No10's point of view nowhere near enough people could say what he stands for now.The argument we are likely to hear is being rehearsed already: the prime minister told Channel 4 News that he has every intention of sticking around as Labour's leader, and made the case for why:\"I am absolutely determined to lead in this fight of our times between renewal, the patriotic cause of the Labour Party and the division and toxic chaos and decline that would come under Reform.\"What, then, of Kemi Badenoch and the Conservative Party?My phone rings and it is a former Conservative cabinet minister on the other end.They say it is \"another unsurprising exit\" and describe Kruger as \"impossible\" and an \"ideologue\".But when I bump into another former Conservative cabinet minister they are more pensive at what they fear the defection says about the Tories.As the Conservatives also approach their annual conference, they confront a moment of peril greater than any in their modern history.And then there is Reform UK.Make no mistake, they face colossal questions:Just for a start, can they build the campaigning infrastructure, the local parties, the list of vetted candidates, the policy heft and attract the talent to present themselves as a viable alternative government?Then there is the cranking up of scrutiny they will now face, such as this story from the BBC's Billy Kenber and Phil Kemp.They are taking on all of this and a lot more in the blink of an eye and it is far from certain it is do-able.But with each passing month, their opponents treat with increasing credibility the possibility it could happen.What we witnessing, so often, in other parties right now is their reaction to that.Conservative PartyKemi BadenochKeir StarmerNigel FarageReform UKLabour Party"

    "content": "Beaten and held in Russia for three years - but never charged with a crime29 minutes agoShareSaveSarah RainsfordSouthern and eastern Europe correspondent, Kyiv regionShareSaveFrancesco Tosto/BBCDmytro Khyliuk spent three and a half years in Russian captivitySince his release from a Russian prison, Dmytro Khyliuk has barely been off the phone.The Ukrainian journalist was detained by Russian forces in the first days of their full-scale invasion. Three and a half years later he's been released in a prisoner swap, one of eight civilians freed in a surprise move. While Russia and Ukraine have swapped military prisoners of war before, it is very rare for Russia to release Ukrainian civilians.Dmytro has been catching up frantically on all he's missed. But he's also phoning the families of every Ukrainian he met in captivity: he memorised all their names and each detail.He knows that for some, his call may be the first confirmation that their relative is alive.The welcome homeThere were celebrations here last month when Dmytro was returned from Russia in a group of 146 Ukrainians.A crowd came out waving blue and yellow national flags, cheering as the buses carrying the freed men passed hooting their horns.Most on board were soldiers with sunken cheeks, emaciated after their years behind bars.Officials won't say exactly how they got the eight Ukrainian civilians back in the same exchange, only that it involved sending back in return \"people Russia was interested in\".One source said those included residents of the Kursk region in Russia, evacuated when Ukrainian forces launched their 2024 incursion. The group's exact status after that is unclear.Ombudsman's OfficeUkrainian officials released photos of the prisoners who finally returned home last month - including DmytroStepping off the bus to a cheering crowd, Dmytro's first phone call was to tell his mother he was free. Both his parents are elderly and unwell and his greatest fear had been never seeing them again.\"The hardest was not knowing when you'll be allowed back. You could be freed the next day or stay prisoner for 10 years. Nobody knows how long it's for.\"Constant crueltyWe met Dmytro shortly after his release as he recuperated at a Kyiv hospital.The details he shared of his captivity are chilling.\"They grabbed us and literally dragged us to the prison and on the way they beat us with rubber batons shouting things like, 'How many people have you killed?'\" he said, describing his transfer to Russia.He was held in multiple facilities and his account chimes with many others we've heard over the years.\"Sometimes they'd let the guard dog off its leash so that it could bite us. The cruelty was really shocking and it was constant.\"He tells me he was bitten and left bleeding. \"I was so stressed I only felt the pain 20 minutes later.\"The journalist was never charged with any crime.Francesco Tosto/BBCDmytro managed to send one note while he was in Russian captivity, reading: \"I'm alive, I'm well. Everything's ok\"Physically the first year was the hardest. \"We were starving. We were given very little food for a long time,\" he remembers. He lost more than 20kg in the first few months, causing him dizzy spells. But the soldiers he was held with were treated far worse.\"They would call them for interrogation, and they were beaten and tortured with electric shock,\" Dmytro remembers.He heard their pain and saw the bruises.His parents' fearThe journalist's family home is a world away from all that, in the pretty village of Kozarovychi just outside Kyiv.It feels peaceful, apart from the air raids, with gardens full of poultry, blackberry bushes and fruit trees.But the back wall of Dmytro's house still has chunks torn out of it by shrapnel and the lawn was only just repaired where Russian troops had parked a tank.In 2022, right at the start of their full-scale invasion when the Russians were advancing on Kyiv, they took over the village.A few days later, as Dmytro and his father, Vasyl, tried to check the damage to their home, they were detained.Francesco Tosto/BBCHalyna (left) and Vasyl (right) are Dmytro's parents - Vasyl was also briefly taken prisoner by the RussiansRussian troops forced both men to the ground, bound and blindfolded them, and marched them into captivity. The pair now know they were held in a basement beneath the local warehouses where the Russians had made their base.The men were moved several times as the number of civilian detainees increased.Vasyl was eventually set free but for many months he feared the worst for his son.\"I didn't know where he'd been taken and I was scared,\" the pensioner tells me. \"There were gunshots at night. One man was taken outside, then a shot was fired. He didn't come back. I still don't know the fate of all the people who were there.\"Then he and his wife got a tiny scrap of paper from a Russian prison.\"I'm alive, I'm well. Everything's ok,\" Dmytro wrote to them both, in Ukrainian. They would receive just one more note in his entire time in captivity.Ukraine's missingOther families have had no news at all.Across Ukraine, officials say more than 16,000 civilians are currently missing. So far, they've only located a fraction of them in Russian prisons.Moscow doesn't publish lists because detaining civilians with no cause is illegal. But that makes getting them back extremely complicated.Forty-three men are still being held from the area around Dmytro's village alone.They include Volodymyr Loburets, detained at the same time, held in the same basements and then moved to Russia. He now has a new grandson he's never met and a family who miss him badly.\"It's hard. It's really hard. We smile, yes, and thank goodness, I have a new grandson,\" Volodymyr's wife Vera says, as baby Yaroslav gurgles beside her on a play mat. \"But I had a husband – and now I don't.\"\"The government says it won't swap our relatives for Russian soldiers, so we are left waiting for the fourth year running until there is some way to get them back.\"Francesco Tosto/BBCVera's husband Volodymyr remains in Russian captivityVera is deeply frustrated. But so is Ukraine's human rights ombudsman.Dmytro Lubinets describes dealing with Russia as like playing chess: you stick to all the rules, only for your opponent to stand up, pull on boxing gloves and punch you.The problem is, Ukraine can't hit back. It has no pool of Russian civilian prisoners because it's against the rules of war under the Geneva Convention. Sending Russian soldiers back in return for Ukrainian civilians would be a disaster. \"The very next day Russia would take thousands of civilians hostage in occupied areas, just to swap for its soldiers,\" the ombudsman points out. \"So Russia is capturing our civilians and there is no legal mechanism to return them.\"There has been one trade involving Ukrainian citizens detained and sentenced here for collaborating with the enemy: a group – said to be volunteers – was swapped for Ukrainian civilians held in Russia.It's not clear whether that has been repeated.Lasting damageFor Dmytro's family, the long and painful wait is almost over. He'll join them in the village as soon as the hospital declares him fit again.His mother, Halyna, jokes that she has a long list of jobs for her only son - fixing all the damage done by the Russians.In fact, she can barely mention his name without crying.\"I can't control my emotions,\" she tells me, in tears. \"When Dima called, he told me to be calm. That he was back in Ukraine and I shouldn't cry anymore. But we haven't seen our son for three and a half years!\"Dmytro is taking it slowly though, because being back here requires some adjusting.\"I knew the war was still going on, but not that they were bombarding Kyiv with drones and that was unexpected and sad,\" he says. \"So the trees are the same, the buildings are the same. But you understand this is a different country. You're in a different reality.\"Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk and Kristina VolkWar in UkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyRussiaVladimir PutinUkraine"

This was the result56 minutes agoShareSaveKristian Johnson and Kate BerryBBC NewsShareSaveBBCElizabeth can spend up to four hours a night in her room watching YouTube videosA group of teenagers from Bradford agreed to take all technology out of their bedrooms for five days to see how they would cope.We followed two of them, Elizabeth and Henry, to capture the highs and lows - and to see how long they lasted before giving in to temptation.Thirteen-year-old Elizabeth says she rarely spends time with her parents after school.The self-confessed Sabrina Carpenter fan normally heads straight to her bedroom for \"three or four hours\" to watch YouTube videos of her pop idol and chat to her friends.\"My bedroom is basically my peace place,\" she says.But she is one of four teenagers at her secondary school to sign up to a tech-free bedroom challenge. It's all part of this year's Teen Summit, a project from Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize Study Support.The annual event explores issues affecting teenagers, from smartphones to social media and knife crime to misinformation.The teenagers will still be able to use their tech, including phones, tablets and laptops - but only in the communal areas of the house.\"It's going to be hard,\" says Elizabeth. \"I'm someone who likes to be in my room.\"Elizabeth's dad, Robin, thinks she will \"crack before the end of the week\" and take her phone into her bedroom.\"That's going to be a challenge for her,\" he says as Elizabeth starts to laugh. He's so confident, in fact, that he's made a bet with his daughter.\"If she cracks, Dad gets a big bag of wine gums.\"Elizabeth (centre) made a bet with her parents that she would be able to last five full days without any technology in her bedroomOther students at Elizabeth's West Yorkshire school are also taking part in the project, including 15-year-old Eliza, who say the lack of private space to talk to friends is on her mind.\"I plan on making it as inconvenient as possible for [my family],\" she says, describing her plan to spend time in shared family spaces, such as \"on the stairs\" and \"on the sofa, but where they want to sit\".Michelle, 15, plans to \"read a book to fall asleep\", instead of staying up on her phone and laptop. She says usually a normal night's sleep can be as little as \"five hours, max\".Henry, 13, spends most of his time at home gaming with his friends online until nine or 10 at night. However \"the latest I've stayed up is probably about 2am,\" he says sheepishly.\"There's sometimes where I'll be gaming that I forget to even drink water.\"Watch: 'I've signed up to give up all my tech in my bedroom'In July, new rules come into force as part of the Online Safety Act to try and make the internet safer for young people.Children's commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza says while these changes are \"welcome and long overdue\", parents should set boundaries for their children by \"introducing phone-free time or unplugging before bed to promote better rest and wellbeing\".An online survey of two thousand 13- to 18-year-olds, conducted for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize by Survation, suggests 38% of the teens who identify as gamers spend seven or more hours per week gaming in their bedroom. One in 10 boys spend more than 20 hours a week in their room away from their family.Henry stored his PlayStation in a cupboard at the start of the week to try and avoid temptation, but it only stayed there for \"about two hours\" before being put into the living room.Henry usually spends several hours a day in his bedroom gaming with his friends onlineIt's a space where his mum, Alyson, often spends her evenings too, with Henry having to remind his friends to not swear when they're speaking on their headsets.Although he says it means he can't \"speak as freely\" with his friends, Alyson says it has helped to \"open up the conversation\" between the pair.It has also made her realise how much of Henry's friendships are built around online gaming.\"That's the biggest part. It's not really about playing the games, it's the social aspect.\"He says another bonus of leaving his tech outside his bedroom at night has meant he hasn't got caught up watching \"billions of videos\" on TikTok just before he goes to sleep.Henry says he is already sleeping much better, which in turn has \"helped in school… in all subjects and all aspects\".'Teens still lots of sleep'Improved sleep quality is something Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, associate prof in digital humanities at University College London, says she would expect the teens to experience after removing digital devices from their rooms.\"There are increasing reports of teens feeling tired during the school day because of their smartphone usage,\" she says.She adds that teens \"still need lots of sleep\", which can be disrupted by overnight notifications or late-night exposure to blue light through smartphone screens.Reflecting on Henry and Elizabeth's gaming, Dr Regehr says basic safety checks parents can do include checking if a teen knows exactly who it is they are gaming with, not having geo-locators turned on, and making sure the themes within the game are age-appropriate.The teenagers were given analogue alarm clocks throughout the week-long experimentBy Wednesday, Elizabeth says she has found other unexpected benefits and has spent her evenings researching ballet lessons and baking chocolate chip bread \"out of boredom\".\"If I still had my tech, I would have procrastinated baking [until] next week,\" she says.Her parents, Robin and Grace, say they've also noticed a change, with Elizabeth choosing to watch documentaries on the family TV rather than online videos in her room.\"[The project has] given her an idea that there's other things to do besides going on your mobile phone and your computer,\" says Robin.'A lot better than sitting at home'As the project comes to an end, the four teenagers swap stories of their tech-free week.Michelle says she almost gave up on the challenge multiple times as she would like \"some peace and quiet\", while Eliza says being in a \"really bad mood\" with her family meant she went to the cinema with her friends.\"It was really fun actually… a lot better than sitting at home,\" she says.\"I wouldn't normally do that stuff, mainly opting to stay on my phone after school.\"But what about the book Michelle planned to read through the week?\"I think I read one chapter, that's it,\" she says, adding \"the reality is it's not going to happen\".Screen time isn't monitored by a quarter of parentsIn a survey of 2,224 13 to 18-year-olds, conducted for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize, young people were asked about various aspects of life - including their smartphone habits, gaming and screen time.The findings of the survey, carried out by polling company Survation, suggest:More than a third (38%) of teenagers said they spent five or more hours on their phones on an average day.39% would consider taking tech and screens out of their bedrooms to reduce time spent on their devicesOther ways to minimise time on their devices include using in-built settings such as screen time caps (59%) or scheduling regular screen time breaks (66%)25% say their parents set clear limits on how much time they spend on tech, gaming or social media, while 47% say their parents sometimes set limitsHowever, more than a quarter (27%) say their parents don't set any limitsBack at home, Henry gleefully rips the 'tech free zone' sign off his bedroom door and instantly moves his PlayStation back onto his desk, but he says he will continue with some new habits he has picked up throughout the week.\"I'll keep my phone outside my bedroom at night because that has helped so much with my sleep.\"\"I'm really proud,\" says his mum, Alyson. \"He's done really well.\"Elizabeth's dad Robin is similarly impressed with his daughter's resilience - but it does mean he lost his bet.\"A deal's a deal,\" he says as he hands over two packets of sweets. \"Well done.\"The BBC asked social media and technology companies for the measures they put in place to help young users limit their screen time.TikTok says that parents can set screen time limits and block their children using the app at certain times using their 'Family Pairing tool'. Also if a user aged under 16 is using TikTok after 10pm it prompts a 'wind down' feature with a full-screen reminder.Snapchat pointed us to their UK parent guide in which it suggests that parents set screen time guidelines with their children.Instagram parent company Meta says that they have introduced 'Instagram Teen Accounts' which switch to sleep mode after 10pm and remind users to leave the app after 60 minutes. There are also parental supervision tools on Instagram, Facebook and Messenger.YouTube says it has \"robust\" parental controls and has recently made its Take a Break and Bedtime reminders more prominent.What happened when 10 teens gave up their smartphones?Are girls being left behind in school?

    "content": "Ready for an autumn declutter? Four ways to get started5 hours agoShareSaveAlex TaylorBBC News, LondonShareSaveGetty ImagesSeptember is the start of another school year and for many of us, there's a feeling of a fresh beginning after the summer holidays. As the darker evenings loom we're likely to spend more time inside making it a natural time to start looking at our homes afresh and to think about decluttering.Tidying our living space can reduce stress and boost our energy levels, according to psychologists.But choosing what to keep and what to get rid of isn't easy, with many of us struggling to decide. BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour spoke to experts on the four best strategies to clear space in your home.Listen to the BBC Woman's Hour special: Decluttering here1. Start smallGetty ImagesThe biggest challenge for many is starting the process, so it's important to give yourself permission to declutter.This includes throwing away items, including gifts, that have been kept through a sense of obligation rather than enjoyment.Going slowly is also a must, says writer and Interior Design Masters judge Michelle Ogundehin.\"It's not about thinking 'right, that's it! It's all got to go!' It's about taking it one step at a time,\" she explains.Ogundehin suggests picking an individual drawer or cupboard first, then building up gradually over time. This makes the task feel manageable rather than overwhelming.2. Plan where to take your itemsGetty ImagesIt is essential to plan ahead for what will happen to the items you discard. Ideally this should be before decluttering begins, or within the first few days.\"You don't want to have piles and piles of stuff building up in the hallway,\" says professional organiser Ingrid Jansen.As the co-founder of Declutter Hub, a community of over 60,000 members alongside a weekly podcast, she says there are ever increasing options for items to be donated, recycled, given away or disposed of.Consider charity shops, or giveaway apps like Freegle and Freecycle, or the tip for items which can't be reused.There's also the option to sell items second hand through online marketplaces such as Vinted or eBay.But, fellow Declutter Hub co-founder Lesley Spellman warns that the lure of upselling can be a double-edged sword.Despite our best intentions, it can lead to churning - the habit of packing items for disposal, without actually moving them on.\"Selling is a fantastic way to make money out of your clutter, but you have to exercise some realism,\" she says.If you're that person that's got three bin bags of stuff still under your desk, it may be time to get rid.Sitting up straight isn't the only secret to good posture - here are three more tipsStruggling with brain fog? Here's how to fix itFeeling stressed? Here's five ways to manage it better3. Prioritise quality not quantityGetty ImagesWe've all heard the phrase \"be brutal!\", but effective decluttering doesn't mean discarding things you love for the sake of it. Instead, Ogundehin advises: \"surround yourself with the things that tell the story that you want them to tell\".\"Keep the things that reinforce you, that uplift you when you walk through the door,\" she adds, be that holiday purchases, pictures, or masterpieces by your children, nephews or nieces.Key to managing this is employing what Ogundehin terms \"containment\" - dedicating set spaces for objects, rather than spreading them endlessly throughout your home.4. Distinguish between nostalgia and sentimentalityGetty ImagesEmotional attachment is one of the main reasons people struggle to let go of items.This attachment is often tied to both nostalgia and sentimentality, but these are distinct concepts says psychotherapist Stelios Kiosses, host of Channel 4's The Hoarder Next Door.Sentimentality refers to the emotional value an item holds in the present, often because it symbolises a relationship, achievement, or important moment to us.Nostalgia, meanwhile, is the feeling of longing for the past - with an item triggering memories.\"You become sentimental about your child's toy, but you're nostalgic of the time you used to play with that toy with your child,\" explains Kiosses.Understanding and recognising the difference between the two can be a \"really important\" route to letting go.Take your children's first pair of shoes. \"You think you keep it for them\", Declutter Hub's Jansen adds, \"but actually it's your memory, because you remember going to shops and buying it with them and thinking how cute they looked.\" So, really think about the reasons behind keeping items and whether they'll genuinely be missed by people still around the home.Either way, these days smartphones allow us to take swift mementos. When a picture speaks a thousand words, do we really need to keep everything?Mindfulness"

The landmark Public Office (Accountability) Bill will force public bodies to cooperate with investigations into major disasters or potentially face criminal sanctions, as well as provide legal funding to those affected by state-related disasters.Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had previously pledged to bring in the law by the 36th anniversary of the tragedy, but Downing Street then said more time was needed to redraft it. Sir Keir Starmer had promised the law by the 36th anniversary of the disaster, which  was on 15 April this yearThe bill will be introduced to Parliament on Tuesday to begin its journey towards becoming law.The government has confirmed a new professional and legal \"duty of candour\" will be part of the bill, meaning public officials would have to act with honesty and integrity at all times and would face criminal sanctions if they breached it.Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James died at Hillsborough, said she was hopeful the new law \"will mean no-one will ever have to suffer like we did\".The disaster, during the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the football ground in Sheffield on 15 April 1989, led to the deaths of 97 football fans.The government said the new legislation would \"end the culture of cover-ups\" and learn lessons from wider disasters including the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon and infected blood scandals.Ms Aspinall said: \"It's been a long journey to get here. I am so grateful to the prime minister for fulfilling his promise to me.\"Margaret Aspinall said she hoped \"no-one will ever have to suffer like we did\"Sir Keir praised Ms Aspinall's \"courage\" and \"the strength of all the Hillsborough families and survivors\" in their long campaign for justice.He said the new legislation would change \"the balance of power in Britain\" to ensure the state could \"never hide from the people it is supposed to serve\".\"Make no mistake, this a law for the 97, but it is also a law for the subpostmasters who suffered because of the Horizon scandal, the victims of infected blood, and those who died in the terrible Grenfell Tower fire,\" he said.One of the bill's architects, Elkan Abrahamson of law firm Broudie Jackson Canter, said there was still some way to go before it became law.\"We will now scrutinise the bill as it makes its passage through parliament, so we're not quite there yet,\" he said.\"But today is still a momentous step, owed entirely to the persistence of campaigners and their refusal to give up. \"The Hillsborough Law will transform the face of British justice.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "content": "Thousands of opioid deaths missed off official figures28 minutes agoShareSaveJack FenwickPolitical correspondentShareSaveFamily handoutHilary's son Ben died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was never included on official opioid death statisticsMore than 13,000 heroin and opioid deaths have been missed off official statistics in England and Wales, raising concerns about the impact on the government's approach to tackling addiction.Research from King's College London, shared exclusively with BBC News, found that there were 39,232 opioid-related deaths between 2011 and 2022, more than 50% higher than previously known.The error has been blamed on the government's official statistics body not having access to post-mortem reports or toxicology results.Data on specific drug deaths is a major driver of policy and it is understood the government is now working with coroners to improve the reporting of deaths.The number of opioid deaths per million people in England and Wales has almost doubled since 2012, but this new study means the scale of the problem is likely to be even greater.Researchers from the National Programme on Substance Use Mortality at King's used data from coroners' reports to calculate a more accurate estimate of opioid-related deaths.Opioids include drugs such as heroin that come from the opium poppy plant, as well as synthetically-made substances like fentanyl.The Liberal Democrats have said the government needs to \"urgently investigate\" how the error was made.The reliability of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) data relies on coroners naming specific substances on death certificates, something which often does not happen.Specific substances such as heroin are instead sometimes only included on more detailed post-mortem reports or toxicology results, which the ONS does not have access to.Government data on overall drug deaths, which does not name specific substances, is not affected by the error, but ministers' decision-making is generally influenced by the more granular statistics.The body that oversees police commissioners says correct data on opioid deaths could have led to more funding and better treatment for front-line services such as police forces and public health.Hilary believes different treatment could have helped her son BenBen was 27 when he died from a heroin overdose in 2018, but his death was ruled as \"misadventure\" and was never included on the official opioid death statistics.His addiction began with cannabis when he was a teenager and progressed to using aerosols and eventually heroin.\"Ben was just a very kind person. We miss him, we all miss him every day,\" said his mother Hilary.At one point, she said Ben appeared to \"turn a corner\".He was awarded a place in a rehab facility, but shortly before he was set to move in, Hilary got the phone call she had always dreaded.\"I think what happened is, he wasn't using,\" she said. \"They think probably about three months and his tolerance had gone down.\"Ben's family believe that different treatment and support for drug addicts could have helped him.Dr Caroline Copeland, who led the new research, said drug policies \"will not have the desired impact unless the true scale of the problem is known\".She added: \"We need to alert coroners to the impact that not naming specific drugs as the cause of death has on the planning and funding of public health policies.\"The research, which has been peer-reviewed and published in the International Journal of Drug Policy, focused specifically on opioid deaths, but similar undercounts are thought to exist in data about deaths from other drugs too.Further work by King's College London has found that 2,482 cocaine-related deaths have also been missed off ONS statistics over the last 10 years.David Sidwick, the drugs lead for the National Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, told the BBC the organisation would \"be pushing hard\" for more treatment funding, in light of the faulty statistics.Mr Sidwick, who is also a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said more accurate data would lead to \"better decisions about the amount of funding required for treatment\" and suggested \"new treatment methods\" such as buprenorphine, a monthly injection that can help heroin users overcome addiction. Helen Morgan, the Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said: \"I dread to think of the lives that may have been lost due to damaging policies based on faulty stats.\"She added: \"The government now needs to step up, launch an investigation and ensure that the ONS is given access to the data it needs so that it can never make this error again.\"The ONS, which helped with the research, said it had warned that \"the information provided by coroners on death registrations can lack detail\" on the specific drugs involved.A spokesperson added: \"The more detail coroners can provide about specific drugs relevant to a death will help further improve these statistics to inform the UK government's drug strategy.\"Cocaine use fuels record high in drug deathsScottish drug deaths fall but remain worst in EuropeThe flaw in the ONS system is not present in Scotland, where there are no coroners and where National Records Scotland (NRS) is responsible for collating official statistics.Unlike the ONS, the NRS does receive more detailed pathology reports, but differences in how deaths are reported across the UK make it difficult to compare.The opioid undercounting raises further questions about the under-fire ONS, which has been accused of failing on several statistical fronts recently.Data sets on job markets and immigration have been criticised and earlier this year a government review said the ONS had \"deep-seated\" issues which needed tackling.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \"We continue to work with partners across health, policing and wider public services to drive down drug use, ensure more people receive timely treatment and support, and make our streets and communities safer.\"Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond.Drug useOffice for National Statistics"

He singled out the Times' endorsement of Kamala Harris in the last presidential election in 2024,  saying it had become a \"mouthpiece for the Radical Left Democrat Party\". Trump added that his lawsuit was being launched in Florida, a Republican stronghold.

He provided no evidence that the boat was carrying drugs.Shortly before, his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro said Caracas would defend itself against US \"aggression\", calling America's top diplomat Marco Rubio the \"lord of death and war\".Tensions between the two countries escalated after the US deployed warships to the southern Caribbean on what officials said were counter-narcotics operations, carrying out a strike which killed 11 people.\"This morning, on my orders, US military forces conducted a second kinetic strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists,\" Trump said on Truth Social.\"These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels pose a threat to US national security.\"The post also included a nearly 30 second video, which appeared to show a vessel in a body of water exploding and then bursting into flames.Speaking later from the Oval Office, Trump said that the US had recorded proof and evidence that the boats belonged to narco-terrorist groups.\"All you have to do is look at the cargo - it was spattered all over the ocean - big bags of cocaine and fentanyl all over the place,\" he said. \"We recorded them. It was very careful, because we know you people would be after us. We're very careful.\" Trump went on to assert that drug trafficking to the US by sea had decreased under recent efforts, but acknowledged that narcotics were still entering the country by land. \"We're telling the cartels right now, we're going to be stopping them too,\" he said. Rubio had earlier on Monday defended the first attack on a boat said to be carrying drugs from Venezuela, which killed all 11 people on board, saying Washington had \"100% fidelity and certainty\" that the vessel was involved in trafficking to the US.\"What needs to start happening is some of these boats need to get blown up,\" he said during an interview on Fox News. He added that Maduro represented \"a direct threat to the national security\" of the US due to his alleged involvement in drug trafficking.Later on Monday, Maduro said that relations with the US had \"been destroyed by their bomb threats\".\"We have moved from a period of battered relations to a completely broken one\".The Venezuelan president said the government would \"fully\" exercise its \"legitimate right to defend itself\".Legal experts previously told the BBC that the fatal strike on the first vessel in international waters may have violated international human rights and maritime law.Asked by a journalist on Sunday whether the US would now \"start doing strikes on mainland Venezuela\", Trump answered: \"We'll see what happens.\"Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, the president said Venezuela was \"sending us their gang members, their drug dealers and drugs\".He said that maritime traffic in the southern Caribbean had reduced significantly \"since the first strike\".Experts raised questions about the legality of the 2 September attack on the alleged drug boat, saying that it may have violated international law. Venezuela responded by flying two F-16 fighter jets over a US Navy destroyer two days later.That led Trump to warn that any Venezuelan jets putting \"us in a dangerous situation\" would be shot down. After a brief lull, tensions rose again on Saturday when Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil accused US forces of boarding a Venezuelan vessel. Gil said the vessel, which he described as a \"small, harmless\" fishing boat, was seized \"illegally and hostilely\" for eight hours.Venezuela Ministry of InformationVenezuela's Ministry of Information released a photo of the vessel it said had been seized for eight hoursIn a statement, the Venezuelan foreign ministry alleged that those who ordered the seizure were \"looking for an incident to justify escalating war in the Caribbean, with the aim of regime change\" in Caracas.The US, and many other nations including the UK, have not recognised the re-election of Maduro in July 2024, pointing to evidence gathered by the opposition with the help of independent observers showing that his rival, Edmundo González, had won the election by a landslide. US officials have also accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel called the Cartel of the Suns and are offering a reward of $50m (£37m) for information leading to his capture. Maduro has denied the allegations and has accused the US of an \"imperialist move\" to depose him. He has called on Venezuelans to enlist in the militia, a force made up of civilians which in the past has been used mainly to boost numbers at political rallies and parades. Public sector workers have reported being pressured into joining the militia. US strike on 'Venezuela drug boat': What do we know, and was it legal?Nicolás MaduroVenezuelaDonald TrumpUnited States"

    "content": "Report those who celebrate Charlie Kirk death to employers, Vance says8 hours agoShareSaveNadine YousifShareSaveWatch: JD Vance hosts Charlie Kirk’s daily talk radio showPeople who celebrate the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk should be held accountable, US Vice-President JD Vance has said.\"Call them out, and hell, call their employer,\" Vance said as he guest-hosted an episode of the Charlie Kirk Show. \"We don't believe in political violence, but we do believe in civility.\"Pilots, medical professionals, teachers and one Secret Service employee are among those who have been suspended or sacked for social media posts that were deemed inappropriate about Kirk's death.Critics have argued the firings threaten free speech and employee protections, although US companies have wide latitude to terminate employees.Vance's comments aired on Monday in an episode of the Charlie Kirk Show, a daily podcast that Kirk hosted before he was shot in the neck last Wednesday while hosting a debate at Utah Valley University.In the episode, the vice-president said that left-wing Americans \"are much likelier to defend and celebrate political violence\", and added that \"there is no civility in the celebration of political assassination\".Charlie Kirk: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movementCharlie Kirk suspect linked to crime scene by DNA, says FBI chiefA recent YouGov poll found liberal Americans were more likely than conservatives to defend feeling joy about the deaths of political opponents.Vance's remarks come as other Republican US lawmakers echoed calls for those publicly celebrating Kirk's death to be punished.\"I will demand their firing, defunding, and license revocation,\" said Florida congressman Randy Fine in a post on X on Sunday, as he called for such people to \"be thrown out of civil society\".South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace urged the Department of Education to \"cut off every dime to any school or university\" that refuses to retaliate against employees making insensitive posts about Kirk.Kirk, a devout Christian, professed viewpoints on gender, race and abortion that drew backlash from many liberals, especially on the campuses he toured.In some cases, those who took to social media to gloat over his death or post comments that caused offence have been fired or placed on leave by employers.Among them is Anthony Pough, a US Secret Service employee who wrote on Facebook that Kirk \"spewed hate and racism on his show... at the end of the day, you answer to GOD, and speak things into existence\".He has had his security clearance revoked.Secret Service Director Sean Curran wrote in a memo to staff that politically motivated attacks are on the rise and members of the protective detail should not be exacerbating the issue.\"The men and women of the Secret Service must be focused on being the solution, not adding to the problem,\" Curran wrote.Americans employed by private companies have also come under scrutiny. Office Depot fired employees at a Michigan branch after a viral video showed staff refusing to print posters for a Kirk vigil, the company confirmed to the BBC in a statement.A spokesperson for Office Depot said the employees' behaviour \"was completely unacceptable and insensitive\", and violated the company's policies.Getty ImagesKirk was a prominent right-wing influencer and a supporter of President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance. Professors and journalists, too, are facing punishment for their comments, provoking a debate over so-called cancel culture. Karen Attiah, a long-time columnist for the Washington Post, wrote in a Substack post that the newspaper had fired her after a series of posts she made on social media platform Bluesky following Kirk's death.In South Carolina, Clemson University said in a statement on Monday that it had fired one employee and placed two professors on leave for what it called \"inappropriate\" social media posts related to Kirk's killing.The repercussions have reached beyond the US. In Canada, University of Toronto professor Ruth Marshall was placed on leave after appearing to write in a social media post that \"shooting is honestly too good for so many of you fascists\". US employers generally have broad discretion to fire workers for any reason, as most staff are hired under \"at-will\" contracts.Steven Collis, a law professor at the University of Texas Austin, said the right to free speech under the US Constitution does not cover private employers. Rather, it applies to government actions restricting citizens' free speech, he said.But Risa Lieberwitz, head of the Worker Institute at Cornell University, said public figures could be infringing on free speech rights if they call for accountability over posts about Kirk. She said the spate of firings was not surprising, given the current heated political rhetoric in the US.\"I think it reflects the kind of fear that exists now in the United States from retaliation by the Trump administration for not adhering to their political agenda,\" she said.Some have criticised the firings, like the American Association of University Professors, who said in a statement on Monday that academic freedom should be protected and \"not curtailed under political pressure\".Charlie Kirk suspect linked to crime scene by DNA, says FBI chiefCharlie Kirk shooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divideHow a college dropout from the suburbs became Maga star Charlie KirkRepublican PartyJD Vance Donald TrumpUnited States"

    "content": "Mark Ronson on being a night person - and Lady Gaga trashing his car5 hours agoShareSaveMark SavageMusic correspondentShareSaveGetty ImagesMark Ronson is one of the UK's most successful producers, scoring hits with everyone from Amy Winehouse and Lady Gaga to Miley Cyrus and Bruno MarsMark Ronson is in trouble.It's summer 1998, and he's hunched over the turntables at New York's venerable VIP bar, Spy.Ronson is there to DJ for Prince, the Purple pipsqueak of funk. It's going well, until he pulls Michael Jackson's Off The Wall from its sleeve, ready to drop the 1979 disco classic Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough.Suddenly, someone's tugging at his arm. It's the rapper Q-Tip, and there's an uncommon urgency to his voice as he shouts: \"No! You can't play that. Not in front of Prince!\"Remembering the star's rivalry with Jackson in the 1980s, Ronson whips the record off the decks. But that leaves him with a problem.\"At this point there's only 20 seconds left [of the previous song]. I pull another record out, but the tempos don't match and I flub the mix.\"Ronson glances over to the VIP area, where Prince is holding court in a plush throne.\"And he's glaring down at me like, 'What is this train wreck?'\"It was slightly humiliating.\"Getty ImagesRonson started DJing in his teens and cut his teeth in the clubs of New YorkLuckily, train wrecks were a rarity. Long before he was an Oscar-winning hitmaker for Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse, Ronson was one of New York's most in-demand DJs.A nocturnal animal, he'd bait his prey with crates of vinyl, swooping in for the kill with a perfectly-timed drop of AC/DC's Back In Black or Busta Rhymes' Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See.\"I could walk into any room and, almost like the Terminator, scan the crowd and be like, 'I know what the first three records are',\" he says.That's as close to boastfulness as Ronson gets. He's so laid-back it's almost comical, speaking in a perpetually sleepy drawl, like the Big Lebowski of music.Mark RonsonThe musician started his vinyl habit earlyWe meet in Notting Hill's Music and Video Exchange – the shop that kick-started his record collection – and it's only when he starts rifling through the racks that the 50-year-old comes to life.\"This one changed my life,\" he says, pulling out a dog-eared copy of Pete Rock's They Reminisce Over You.\"Oh, and here's Salt-N-Pepa's Shoop… Now, that's my song!\"A similar enthusiasm permeates Ronson's new memoir, Night People, which concentrates on the 1990s DJ career that saw him playing for everyone from Jay-Z to Mariah Carey.\"She had very specific songs she wanted to hear,\" he recalls. \"There was a great R&B record called Say I'm Your Number One, by Princess, that she'd always request.\"Eventually, I just knew to play it as soon as I saw her, to save her a trip to the booth.\"When he pitched the book, which ends long before his successes with Winehouse on Back To Black and Bruno Mars on Uptown Funk, \"people were scratching their heads\", Ronson admits.\"They were like, 'Oh right, so you want to write about the time before the thing we know you for?'\"Getty ImagesRonson produced several of the key tracks on Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, including Rehab and the title songBut he stuck to his guns. The memoir is a heartfelt love letter to a bygone era, inspired by the death of his close friend and contemporary DJ Blu Jemz in 2018.\"I was just staring at all the records [we used to play] on my shelf, thinking about how each one was so evocative of a memory and a moment in time.\"It's arguably the last time New York was the apex of hip-hop both creatively and commercially - A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls, Lil' Kim, Busta Rhymes... all of it. And they were out in the clubs every night.\"Another figure who loomed over the scene was P Diddy, aka Sean Combs, who's currently awaiting sentencing in New York after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution.Diddy gave Ronson one of his big breaks, hiring him to play at A-list events, including his 29th birthday party, after tipping the DJ with a $100 bill containing his phone number.\"It's undeniable that the way he picked me for certain gigs elevated my star,\" says Ronson, calling the accusations against Diddy \"horrific\".\"I had no idea of anything like that going on,\" he says, acknowledging the musician \"wielded a tremendous amount of power and cachet\" in New York.\"But in the five years I DJ'd for him, I doubt he spoke more than five sentences to me. \"He was mostly out there dancing and I knew if he was dancing, no-one was gonna yell at me.\"Mark RonsonRonson's mother Ann Dexter-Jones later divorced his father Laurence Ronson and married Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones, who wrote I Want To Know What Love Is for herAt the outset, Ronson wanted his book to capture the seediness of 90s club culture, where he'd play \"night in, night out for $100\" while \"cokehead club owners shouted at me for not playing enough Madonna\".As he wrote, another story also emerged.Ronson was born in London to jewellery designer Ann Dexter-Jones and music publisher Laurence Ronson. Their house in St John's Wood was a frequent haunt for actors and musicians, including Keith Moon and Robin Williams.\"My parents had crazy parties all the time,\" he recalls. \"Fifty or 60 slightly cracked people, smoking, drinking, having a great time.\"The aftermath was drastically different. In the book, he writes of \"angry crescendos and heavy silences\" from his parents' bedroom, which instilled a \"constant watchfulness that became instinct before I understood why\".Later in life, DJing fulfilled a \"need for control\" that stemmed from that early instability.\"It wasn't always the greatest way to grow up for a kid, and there was something about the DJ booth that was incredibly comforting.\"It's like I'm an army of one. I make all the rules. It's a refuge, in a way.\"Getty ImagesRonson won an Oscar for co-writing Shallow with Lady Gaga, Andrew Wyatt (left) and Anthony Rossomando (second left)Learning to navigate delicate situations also helped Ronson's career as a producer.There's an almost too-perfect example in Lady Gaga's documentary Five Foot Two where, arriving for a recording session, the star crashes into Ronson's car.Mortified, she enters the studio in a garbled flurry of apologies. Ronson simply stretches out his arms for a conciliatory hug.\"If you have a problem, I wish you'd just say it to my face instead of my bumper,\" he deadpans.The situation is immediately defused.Reminded of the scene, he says: \"I remember working on that record [2016's Joanne] pretty well, and Lady Gaga is probably one of the most chased, hounded, paparazzi-ed people you could imagine.\"Sometimes we'd slam the door and there'd be 20 people on the other side taking pictures. So my role is just to shut out the outside world [and] make the artist feel relaxed and comfortable at all times.\"Even when they've trashed your car.\"Ronson spent hours rifling through the racks at shops like London's Music and Video Exchange as an aspiring teenage DJHis unflappability also helped along Winehouse's Back To Black, bringing focus to a feverish creative streak.\"I remember some of my friends saying, 'Oh, you're working with Amy? Good luck. She's been working on this album for three years',\" he recalls.\"But when we got in the studio, she was such a fireball of inspiration. We demoed three or four songs, we wrote Back to Black, she wrote Rehab... All these things in five days. It's a lot of incredible memories.\"Other songs took longer. Uptown Funk needed seven months. Dua Lipa's Barbie anthem Dance The Night was rewritten \"five or six times with different hooks\".But those are stories for another time... and \"maybe\" a second volume of Ronson's memoir.Right now, though, I've lost him to the record store's vinyl bins, picking out old favourites by the Stone Roses, Brand New Heavies and Cypress Hill - and prompting a moment of introspection.\"There are people who enjoy a night out and then there are night people,\" he decides.\"I was definitely the latter... but I had no idea where it would take me.\"Mark Ronson breaks down the Barbie soundtrack'You’ve got to move at the speed of inspiration'Hip-hopMusic"

    "title": "'Crisis for PM grows' and Owen Cooper wins Emmy at 15",
    "content": "'Crisis for PM grows' and Owen Cooper wins Emmy at 152 hours agoShareSaveShareSaveA number of the papers have suggested that there is increasing pressure on the UK prime minister after the resignation of his aide Paul Ovenden following the publication of \"lewd\" WhatsApp messages. The Guardian says that the \"crisis engulfing Keir Starmer has deepened on the eve of Donald Trump's visit to the UK\". A photograph of 15-year-old Owen Cooper holding his Emmy aloft is front and centre for the paper, after the teenager became the youngest male Emmy winner for his starring role in Adolescence.The Metro describes this as Sir Keir's third \"political crisis\" in 10 days, after Downing Street's director of strategy was forced to quit over offensive texts about ex-Labour MP Diane Abbott. The messages were initially reported in the Daily Mail, and are understood to have been made eight years ago, as part of an online private conversation. In a statement. Mr Ovenden said he was \"truly, deeply sorry for it and the hurt it will cause\".\"Starmer fights for his future\" says the i Paper, also leading on the \"embattled\" prime minister's \"fortnight from hell\".\"Mandelson emails add to pressure on Starmer\" declares the Times, alleging that the prime minister knew about the emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein prior to defending him in the Commons. The paper says he will face a three-hour emergency debate on his handling of the scandal, just hours before Donald Trump touches down on UK soil for a state visit. A photograph of Owen Cooper leads the paper, captioned \"Class act\". The US president is expected to \"go easy\" on Starmer according to the Telegraph, despite knowing he is \"on the ropes\". Monday saw the prime minister make his first public comments since sacking Lord Mandelson, and the Telegraph says he \"appeared to blame his advisers\". Sir Keir insisted that he would not resign as he was \"absolutely clear what the task is in front of me\".\"Meltdown!\" warns the Mail, reporting that MPs have said Sir Keir will be \"out by May\" as unrest within the Labour party mounts. Sydney Sweeney is pictured on the front page of the paper, directing readers a story on whether the actress was \"shunned\" at the Emmys over her support of Trump. A Truth Social post from Trump is the main story for the Financial Times, after the president told US companies to stop reporting quarterly results and copy China's \"more long-term approach\". TikTok's long-awaited sale has also made the front page, and the paper reports that a \"framework deal\" has been reached some 18 months after American operations were \"thrown into doubt\". The deal is yet to be approved by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \"In name of the 97\" reads the headline of the Mirror, reporting on new legislation named after the Hillsborough victims. The law will force public officials to tell the truth during investigations into major disasters. It took 27 years before a court finally ruled that those who died were unlawfully killed, and that the fans who were caught up in the crush bore no responsibility for causing it.\"Millions will face another surge in food bills\" warns the Express, reporting that inflation on food and drink is expected to hit 5.7% by Christmas. The paper says there are fears that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will introduce \"another punishing tax raid\" in her Autumn budget, driving up prices ahead of the holiday season.Prince Harry is pictured on the front page of the Star, after he told the Guardian that he \"didn't air dirty linen\" in his book Spare. The Daily Telegraph says that the first deportation under the government's one-in, one-out scheme has been \"cancelled\" at the last minute. The paper said it understood a migrant was due to be flown from Heathrow to Paris on an Air France flight but it was postponed amid protest by charities and threats of legal action. The Home Office said it expected the first returns to take place imminently.The Guardian argues that the departure of a third senior ally of the prime minister in two weeks has raised more questions about the stability of his government. Paul Ovenden quit as Sir Keir Starmer's director of political strategy after the publication of WhatsApp messages in which he relayed lewd jokes made about the MP, Diane Abbott. The paper says it's been a \"bruising two weeks\" for Sir Keir Starmer. \"Meltdown,\" is the Daily Mail's verdict.Nigel Farage tells the Times that several more senior Tories could join Reform UK, after Danny Kruger's defection. But he said it was important first to make sure they were genuinely onside with Reform in policy terms, and they had to be coming to help, not just for a meal ticket.The Daily Telegraph suggests Donald Trump is likely - in the paper's words - to go easy on Sir Keir Starmer during his state visit because he understands the pressure the prime minister is under. Two former US officials well connected with the White House said the trip, for Trump, was likely to be about the splendour of Windsor Castle rather than day-to-day politics.According to the Daily Express, millions of households face price rises on food in the run-up to Christmas, amid fears the Chancellor could raise taxes for businesses. Retailers in particular have warned Rachel Reeves against a repeat of anything like the hike to employers national insurance contributions.And the Daily Mirror welcomes the introduction of what has been called the Hillsborough Law. The legislation will hold officials and public bodies criminally responsible if they lie to cover up scandals. The paper says the move honours the 97 Liverpool fans killed in the tragedy in 1989.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.Related Internet LinksDaily ExpressDaily MailDaily MirrorDaily StarDaily TelegraphFinancial TimesGuardianIndependentMetroSunThe iTimes"

    "title": "Hillsborough Law - what is it and how did we get here?",
    "content": "Hillsborough Law - what is it and how did we get here?8 hours agoShareSaveJudith MoritzSpecial correspondentShareSaveGetty ImagesNinety-seven people died because of the Hillsborough disaster. Hundreds more were injured. And there are many still living with psychological damage wrought by the stadium crush.While this suffering springs from the day of the disaster - 15 April 1989 - it's been compounded by the prolonged struggle for justice since then.Following the news that an agreement has been reached on the long-awaited introduction of the Public Office (Accountability) Bill on Tuesday - commonly referred to as Hillsborough Law - here's a reminder of how we got here.Inquests and trialsIt took 27 years before a court finally ruled that those who died were unlawfully killed, and that the fans who were caught up in the crush bore no responsibility for causing it. Those were amongst the findings of the second set of Hillsborough inquests, which finished in 2016. The verdicts were marked with singing outside the coroner's court, as bereaved families and survivors celebrated a hard-fought moment.They weren't to know that it would be nearly another decade before they had cause to celebrate again.In the aftermath of the inquests, there was high expectation. Campaigners felt that the 2012 Hillsborough Independent Panel, and the resultant two-year-long inquests, had at last given them the truth about what happened. But there had been no accountability. No justice.Criminal trials would follow, but with little to show for them. The only person to be convicted was a Sheffield Wednesday club official who was fined £6,500 for a health and safety offence. The senior police officer in charge at Hillsborough, David Duckenfield, was acquitted of gross negligence manslaughter after two trials. A third trial, of two officers and a solicitor accused of amending police statements, collapsed.Hillsborough safety officer fined £6,500Hillsborough police chief cleared of manslaughterWhy the Hillsborough prosecutions collapsedA police misconduct investigation, run by the Independent Office for Police Conduct, has been running since 2012 - and is yet to publish its final report. Meanwhile, some survivors and families who made complaints about individual officers have recently been receiving letters notifying them of the outcomes. Plenty have waited all this time, only to find that their complaints have not been upheld.Campaigners died fighting for justiceMany of those I speak to in the Hillsborough community have been feeling despondent. They've come to see that moment of celebration after the inquests as their high-water mark. To some it even feels as though things have gone backwards, with fears that the false blame narrative will take hold once more.And the years continue to pass - it's 36 since the disaster. Some of those bereaved by Hillsborough have now themselves passed away. Prominent campaigners like Anne Williams, Phil Hammond, Rose Robinson and Barry Devonside are no longer here to speak out.But amongst those left, there is still determination. A will to ensure that a positive legacy can be wrought from the wreckage of Hillsborough. The 'very human lesson' from HillsboroughThe creation of a Hillsborough Law will go a long way to help with that.What is the law?Like everything else, its genesis has been a struggle. Its first seeds were sown nearly a decade ago, in April 2016, after the inquest verdicts. Despite sharing in that triumph, barrister Pete Weatherby KC, who represented 22 families, was less positive than most at that point. For him, the inquests had exposed two particular injustices which remained unresolved.Firstly, there had been no legal obligation for the public authorities involved to co-operate with the process fully or transparently. Information could be withheld. A culture of reputational defensiveness was able to take root, and false narratives were re-run. The inquests, originally listed for six months, had ended up lasting for two years - in part because they became so adversarial. Pete believed that a legal \"duty of candour\" was needed, so that civil servants could face consequences if they put toeing the party-line above telling the truth at inquiries. A \"duty to assist\" was required too - to force officials to proactively supply information to inquiries.Otherwise, he reasoned, there was nothing to prevent other state failings being denied and covered up, like Hillsborough had been.Secondly, there was the issue of a real imbalance when it came to funding legal representation. For years, the Hillsborough families had had to scrimp, save, and fundraise to pay for lawyers. Their costs at the inquests - which would eventually run to more than £63m - were only bearable because they were met by the Home Office which set up a special scheme to cover them. The families' lawyers were paid the same rate as those representing the police and other state bodies.But there was no guarantee that the government would repeat this arrangement for others. The authorities would always have access to expensive lawyers, while victims of different scandals and disasters stood to be outgunned in court without equal funding.Pete felt that parity of funding should also be enshrined in legislation. The barrister, who was used to arguing points of law in court, now sat down to write the first rough draft of a proposed new law. His efforts were soon bolstered by the other lawyers who'd represented the various Hillsborough families. Together they created the Public Authority (Accountability) Bill, which captured the two key principles of full candour and equal funding.The unwieldy title soon became shorthanded as Hillsborough Law. It had the backing of the families and survivors. There was plenty of political support too and in March 2017 it was presented to Parliament with cross party sponsorship, including that of then MP Andy Burnham. Families are still searching for answers - mayorWhat has caused its delay?But the Bill's progress was halted when the 2017 General Election was called, and it fell. Subsequent governments have chosen not to reintroduce it.The years since then have been hard going for the Hillsborough Law Now campaign. Its architects wanted the law to be put in place to help victims of other disasters involving the state. Instead they watched as a raft of tragedies occurred, including the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in west London, the Manchester Arena attack (also 2017), and the Post Office, Infected Blood and Nuclear Test Veteran scandals – all the while, no progress was made on their bill.Indeed, many of the justice campaigns for those disasters have joined the Hillsborough Law Now group, finding common cause and mutual strength.What happens now?Finally, last year, when Labour came back into power, the Hillsborough Law was reborn. It was announced in the King's Speech, and the government pledged to introduce it by the time the next anniversary of the disaster arrived on 15 April 2025. But that date came and went, and nothing happened.In July 2025, Liverpool MP Ian Byrne tried to re-introduce the original 2017 version of the bill to the House of Commons for a second reading - but he was blocked. The government was determined to draft its own version of the law, rather than adopt the former bill wholesale.I understand that for the last year, behind the scenes there has been a lot of negotiation between government ministers and civil servants on one side, and Hillsborough Law campaigners on the other. I believe that there was substantial opposition to enacting such legislation from various sources.Ministers may well have been ready to introduce a version of the Bill before now, but without all the key provisions that campaigners hold vital. The prospect of the government introducing a Hillsborough Law without the backing of the majority of the disaster's families and their supporters would have been farcical.But the forthcoming Labour Party conference - happening in Liverpool later this month - may well have focused minds. The announcement that the agreement has finally been reached will prevent a hostile reception from some in the city.It's worth saying that not all of those bereaved by Hillsborough are equally supportive of the law. But many have been vocal in backing it and, having felt despondent about the lack of success on other fronts, say they now have something positive to point to.It's not game over, though. The Bill will still have to make progress through Parliament. Its detail will be debated. There's concern that there is still political will from some quarters - both inside and outside government - to undermine it as it travels through the legislative process.Campaigners tell me that there is still room for improvement in the drafting of the Bill. They say they intend to remain \"hyper-vigilant\" during this process, holding the government to account, to ensure the law is passed in full. They say it has to be practical and effective - not just a law in name alone, but one that has real impact.Only then will they feel that Hillsborough has left a legacy which they can stand by, and which will help prevent others experiencing a similar tortuous journey.Hillsborough disasterHillsborough trialsLiverpool"

You either fight back or you die.\"He also said there had to be \"a change of government in Britain\" and that there should be a \"dissolution of Parliament and a new vote held\".Responding to his comments, Mahmood said: \"Whether you're a hostile state or a hostile billionaire, no-one gets to mess with British democracy.\"She added that the \"vast majority\" of people would react to Musk's words with \"a shake of the head\".Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has also criticised Musk, telling the BBC: \"He doesn't use language sensibly, he is deeply irresponsible, deeply dangerous.\"Earlier on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, Sir Ed had said British democracy was \"too precious to be a plaything for foreign tech barons\" adding: \"Elon Musk doesn't care about the British people or our rights. He only cares about himself and his ego.\"Musk said Sir Ed was \"a craven coward\".More than 150,000 people attended the \"Unite The Kingdom\" march in London organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson. Around 5,000 joined a counter-protest organised by Stand Up To Racism.Robinson tapping into disquiet in the country, says minister'I'm angry. It's not right' - locals want asylum hotels shut, but are shared houses the answer?Dozens of officers injured as up to 150,000 join Tommy Robinson rallySpeakers at the main protest expressed anti-immigration sentiments and spoke in favour of freedom of speech.As part of the event, Musk had a conversation with Robinson during which he made his controversial comments.Musk said: \"I think there's something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration.\"This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn't get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. \"They don't want that, they're quiet, they just go about their business.\"My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice.\"Asked about his comments in Parliament, Mahmood said Britain was \"a tolerant country and yes, we are a diverse country\".\"You can be English with roots that stretched back a thousand years.\"But you can also be English and look like me.\"Earlier, a Downing Street spokesman echoed Mahmood's comments saying: \"The last thing the British people want is this sort of dangerous and inflammatory language which threatens violence and intimidation on our streets.\"I don't think the British people will have any truck with that kind of language and rightly so.\"Asked if the government would review its use of X, the spokesman said government communications were always kept under review.The Liberal Democrats have called on the government to rule out awarding contracts to Musk's Tesla company which produces electric vehicles, batteries and  solar panels. Speaking to Newsnight, Sir Ed said: \"He [Musk] has applied to Ofgem for a licence to sell and distribute energy in this country... they are the sorts of things we should look at.\" He also said he would encourage people to leave Musk's social media platform X but that he would be staying, saying the Liberal Democrats were \"calling him out on his own platform\". Taking questions at a press conference on Monday, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage was also asked about Musk's language.He said there was a \"degree of ambiguity\" in his words but added: \"If the fight that Musk was talking about was about standing up for our rights and free speech, if it was about fighting in elections to overcome the established parties, then that absolutely is the fight that we're in.\"Musk had previously expressed support for Farage and had reportedly been in talks over donating money to the party. However, earlier this year he appeared to cool on the idea, saying Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party. Elon MuskKeir StarmerNigel FarageEd Davey"

    "content": "UK jets to defend Polish skies after Russian drone incursion11 hours agoShareSaveAlex Boyd andJonathan Bealedefence correspondentShareSaveMinistry of DefenceFighter jets from the UK will join Nato allies in defending Polish airspace after last week's incursion of Russian drones, the defence secretary has confirmed.RAF Typhoon jets will fly air defence missions over Poland as part of the military alliance's mission to bolster the eastern flank.Other allies including Denmark, Germany and France are already taking part - a jet from the latter was scrambled earlier on Monday in response to another potential incursion by Russian drones. Nato said that alert was quickly over.Tensions have risen across Europe since Poland accused Russia of the incident, which saw 19 drones enter its territory. Moscow has insisted the incident was not deliberate.The Typhoons will still operate out of RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and are expected to start flying missions in the coming days, supported by RAF Voyager air-to-air refuelling aircraft. They will join Danish F-16s, French Rafales and German Eurofighters.Defence Secretary John Healey said: \"The message to Moscow is clear. Putin tested Nato, Nato responded with unity, and the UK will play our full part. When we are threatened, we respond together.\"He also described Russia's actions as \"reckless, dangerous, and unprecedented\".Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Typhoons joining the mission - named Eastern Sentry - was \"vital in deterring aggression, securing NATO airspace, and protecting our national security and that of our allies\".Drones and missiles have occasionally veered into countries bordering Ukraine, including Poland, during Russia's full-scale invasion - but this was the most serious incident of its kind and the first time a Nato member has directly engaged Russian drones since the war began in February 2022.Healey said Russia was testing Nato's air defences, while Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said it was \"the closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two\".In a separate incident on Sunday, Romania - also a Nato member - said a Russian drone had breached its airspace.Romanian fighter jets were in the air monitoring a Russian attack in Ukraine on Saturday and were able to track the drone near Ukraine's southern border, the defence ministry said.The drone later disappeared from the radar and did not pose imminent danger, the ministry added.Initial indications suggest the drones fired into Polish airspace last week were Gerbera 'decoy' drones rather than armed ones. There were no casualties.The incident led Poland to invoke Nato's Article 4, which allows member countries to bring any issues of concern - especially related to security - to the North Atlantic Council, the alliance's main political decision-making body.Soon after those talks on 10 September, Nato confirmed it would boost defences on its eastern flank.On other occasions over the past 18 months, the RAF has deployed Typhoons to both Poland and Romania to protect Nato airspace, according to the Ministry of Defence.Who is in Nato and what are Article 4 and Article 5?Could this be the most significant Nato summit since the Cold War?At a glance: Key points from government's defence strategyRoyal Air ForceRussiaNatoPoland"

Leviev previously denied the allegations.Authorities did not immediately provide details of the reason for the arrest of Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Yehuda Hayut.In 2019, Leviev was convicted of four charges of fraud in a separate case and sentenced to 15 months in prison, but he was released after serving only five months.According to Israel's Ynet website, his lawyer told reporters Leviev had been \"traveling freely around the world\".\"I spoke with him this morning after he was detained, but we don't yet understand the reason,\" they said after his arrest in Georgia.Between 2017 and 2019, Leviev's catfishing scheme - creating a false online persona - involved luring women into romantic relationships with an extravagant lifestyle of private jets and luxury holidays.His victims shared their stories in the documentary series, saying they were courted by Leviev with glamorous gifts and getaways to gain their trust.They said Leviev would later pretend he was being pursued by his \"enemies\" and ask them to transfer him significant sums of money, before breaking off all contact.Cecilie Fjellhøy, one of the women featured in the Netflix series, said she gave Leviev more than $270,000 over the course of their relationship.Last year, another woman Iren Tranov, filed a lawsuit against Leviev in Israel for 414,000 shekels (£91,000), saying she lent him more than 144,000 shekels (£31,000) which he never repaid.Leviev previously told BBC Newsbeat he strongly denied the accusations made against him in the documentary.Speaking to the BBC in 2023, Kate Konlin, a former girlfriend of Leviev's, also accused him of emotional and physical abuse while they were together.During an argument, Ms Konlin said he pushed her and she cut her foot on a step with a rough edge.\"I was bleeding. I felt dead. I wanted to kill myself,\" she said.After going to hospital, she filed a complaint against Leviev with the police.Leviev later rejected the accusations and said he had never physically harmed any woman.The Tinder Swindler became Netflix's most-watched documentary in 90 countries when it was released in February 2022.Why I stood by my abusive ex, the Tinder SwindlerFrom The Tinder Swindler to Celebs Go DatingTinderGeorgiaNetflixFraud"

    "content": "Chinese teens to pay $300,000 for urinating in soup3 hours agoShareSaveKelly NgSingaporeShareSaveGetty ImagesThe teenagers, who were drunk, had posted a video of their act onlineTwo teenagers who peed into a pot of broth at a hotpot restaurant have been ordered to pay 2.2m yuan ($309,000; £227,000) to two catering companies in China.The incident, which happened in February at a Shanghai branch of China's biggest hotpot chain Haidilao, sparked widespread criticism after the 17-year-olds posted a video of their drunken act online.There is no suggestion that anyone consumed the contaminated broth but Haidilao had offered to pay thousands of diners who dined at the restaurant in the days following the incident. In March, Haidilao sought more than 23m yuan in losses, saying this took into account the amount it compensated customers over the incident.Last Friday, a Shanghai court found that the teenagers had infringed upon the companies' property rights as well as reputation through \"acts of insult\", noting that their actions contaminated tableware and \"caused strong discomfort among the public\".It also found that the teens' parents had \"failed to fulfil their duty of guardianship\" and ordered that they bear the compensation, state media reported. This includes 2m yuan for operational and reputational damage, 130,000 yuan to one of the caterers for tableware losses and cleaning expenses, and 70,000 yuan in legal costs.However the court ruled that any additional compensation Haidilao offered to its customers, beyond what they were billed, was a \"voluntary business decision\", and therefore should not be borned by the teenagers.Haidilao had offered to compensate more than 4,000 diners who visited the branch between 24 February - the date of their visit - and 8 March, both with a full refund and a cash compensation that is 10 times the amount they were billed.They also replaced all hotpot equipment and said they had conducted cleaning and disinfection works. Haidilao has expanded quickly since it opened its first restaurant in Jianyang in Sichuan province. It now operates more than 1,000 restaurants across the world.The company is known for its customer service and family-friendly atmosphere, where ladies can receive manicures and kids are treated to candy floss while waiting for a table.AsiaChina"

    "content": "Belarus and Russia's show of firepower appears to be a message to Europe15 hours agoShareSaveSteve RosenbergBBC Russia editor in BelarusShareSaveReutersThe drills coincide with a period of heightened tension in the eastern European regionIn a large field 45 miles (72km) from Belarus' capital Minsk, a battle is raging.There are giant explosions as Sukhoi-34 bombers drop guided bombs. Huge plumes of smoke darken the sky. The whole area echoes to the sound of exploding mortar and artillery shells. Helicopter gunships join the attack, while surveillance drones sweep overhead to view the damage.It's only an exercise, though.The BBC's Steve Rosenberg says the drills come at a time of \"high tension\"Together with other international media we've been brought to the Borisovsky training ground where Belarusian and Russian forces are taking part in joint manoeuvres. It's part of the Zapad-2025 (\"West 2025\") military drills. Military attachés, too, from a variety of embassies are observing the drill from a viewing platform.These are planned exercises - \"West 2025\" takes place every four years. In 2022 200,000 troops took part, while this year's exercises involved fewer soldiers.Moscow and Minsk maintain that the drills are of a purely defensive nature, that they're designed to strengthen the security of Russia and Belarus and to counter any potential external threat.I remember hearing similar claims three and a half years ago.In February 2022 I visited Belarus to report on the Belarusian-Russian military exercise \"Union Resolve\". When the exercise was over, instead of returning home Russian troops invaded neighbouring Ukraine from the territory of Belarus.This time Belarus insists it has nothing to hide.Representatives of 23 states, including the US, Turkey and Hungary, watched the military exercise.\"We consider that the exercise is unprecedented in its transparency,\" Major General Valery Revenko, assistant to the Belarusian defence minister, told journalists at the training ground.\"We are not threatening anyone. We are for constructive and pragmatic dialogue.\"Clearly Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk isn't convinced. He had dubbed the \"West 2025\" drills \"very aggressive\". Poland shut its border with Belarus ahead of the exercises, prompting an angry response from Minsk.\"West 2025\" coincides with a period of heightened tension in the eastern European region. To the south, Russia shows no sign of ending its war on Ukraine.Last week Poland accused Russia of intentionally violating its air space with a Russian drone incursion. Nato scrambled fighter jets to shoot down some of the drones.Moscow responded by claiming that it \"hadn't planned to engage targets on Polish territory.\"Yesterday Romania revealed that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, too. In Europe there is widespread concern that such drone incursions are no accident, but a Russian strategy to test the unity and resolve of European leaders and of the Nato alliance.Both Russia and Belarus have made efforts recently to improve ties with Washington and to construct a relationship with the Trump administration. But in the case of both Moscow and Minsk relations with Europe remain strained.The decision by the Belarusian authorities to invite international media to the \"West 2025\" exercise can be seen two ways.First, as an attempt at transparency - that's certainly how Minsk is portraying it.But in the explosions and the gunfire on the Borisovsky training ground there is, perhaps too, a message for the West. And first and foremost, for Europe.That message may read something like this: \"See and consider the firepower on your doorstep; confrontation with Moscow is not in your best interest.\"As Russian army inches closer, Ukrainians must decide to stay or goUkraine in maps: Tracking the war with RussiaWar in UkraineBelarusRussiaUkraine"

    "content": "Constance Marten and Mark Gordon jailed for 14 years over baby's death13 hours agoShareSaveAlex BoydShareSaveWatch: Moment judge sentences Gordon and Marten to at least 14 yearsA couple have been jailed for 14 years for the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn daughter when they went on the run with her to avoid dealing with social services.Constance Marten, 38, and Mark Gordon, 51, were sentenced on Monday after being found guilty in July following a lengthy retrial at the Old Bailey.The decomposed body of their baby, Victoria, was found in a shopping bag in Brighton in 2023. Police had been searching for the couple for 53 days after officers found evidence of a recent birth in a burnt-out car near Bolton.Passing sentence, Judge Mark Lucraft KC told the couple \"neither of you gave much thought to the care or welfare of your baby\" and said there had been \"no genuine expression of remorse\" from either of them.They were sentenced on the basis Victoria died of hypothermia - both defendants had argued against that during the hearing.Gordon will serve a further four years on extended licence, the judge said. There was no reaction from either defendant as they were sentenced.The first trial found Marten and Gordon guilty of concealing the birth of a child, perverting the course of justice by not reporting her death, and of child cruelty, but the jury failed to reach a verdict on the manslaughter charge.The court heard that, when Marten was heavily pregnant, they had decided to live off grid to avoid Victoria being taken off them by social care authorities. Their four other children had previously been taken into care.During the police manhunt that spanned different parts of England once the circumstances of the birth were uncovered, the couple slept outside and took steps to avoid being found, such as taking long taxi rides that criss-crossed the country.They were eventually located on 27 February 2023, and Victoria was discovered dead two days later in an allotment shed in the Hollingbury area of Brighton.She had died while the couple were living in a tent on the South Downs in January that year.The chaotic lives of a couple who killed their baby daughterI've never seen a case like Constance Marten and Mark Gordon's - it was jaw-droppingWatch: How police traced Constance Marten and Mark GordonIn their trial, the couple had said Victoria's death was a tragic accident after Marten fell asleep holding the baby - but the prosecution called on evidence from experts on hypothermia, one of whom described the conditions the newborn would have experienced living in a tent in the middle of winter.During a months-long retrial, the judge said the couple tried to \"sabotage\" and \"manipulate\" proceedings.Firstly there were many days when one or other of them claimed illness, dental pain or just tiredness from travelling back and forth to court from their respective jail cells, causing proceedings to overrun by many months.When in court, both displayed disruptive and unpredictable behaviour, disrespected the judge, were rude to dock officers and would often talk during proceedings.On one occasion, Judge Lucraft said about Marten that he has \"never had that sort of attitude\" shown to him by anyone in his 13 years as a full-time judge.During the latter stages of the retrial, Gordon parted company with his legal team and took on the role of representing himself in court, despite having no legal training.Disruption continued during Monday's sentencing hearing, during which the judge told off both defendants for passing notes in the dock. He told them it showed \"a complete lack of respect\".Julia QuenzlerJudge Mark Lucraft said the pair tried to blame everyone else during their trialsDuring mitigation, Marten's barrister Tom Godfrey told the court: \"The sorrow that Constance Marten feels is incalculable.\"He added: \"She has, ever since an early stage, accepted that her baby died as a result of something she did. That fact weighs very heavily on her conscience and will do so for the rest of her life.\"Philippa McAtasney KC, the barrister representing Gordon during the sentencing, said Gordon had told her \"I regret that things happened the way they happened\" and that he will \"live with this for the remainder of his life\".During the retrial, the jurors were told of Marten's privileged upbringing in a wealthy family. They also learned that Gordon had been convicted of rape in Florida in 1989 when he was aged 14.For legal reasons, this conviction - for which he was sentenced to 40 years in prison and deported back to the UK after serving 20 years - was not made known during the first trial, but was disclosed the second time around.In August, the Court of Appeal confirmed to the BBC it had received an application on behalf of Marten to appeal against her conviction."

    "content": "Who will win Champions League? BBC Sport experts make predictionsByChris BevanBBC Sport journalistPublished15 September 2025808 CommentsThe Champions League is back, but who will get their hands on the famous old trophy this season?Holders Paris St-Germain are one of 36 teams who begin the league phase this week, including six English sides - a record number for any country in the competition.Starting on Tuesday, there are a total of 189 games to be played, including the final at Budapest's Puskas Arena next May.We have asked some of BBC Sport's expert pundits, commentators and journalists who they think will lift the trophy in Hungary, as well as who will go furthest out of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.They have also picked their surprise package, and the player they are most looking forward to watching.And you can vote for who you think will be the winners below.Don't forget the BBC will again show highlights of the Champions League this season.From 22:00 BST on the Wednesday of Champions League weeks, there will be match-by-match highlights available on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app, plus a special Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One at 22:40.This week there will also be be a highlights show on Thursday on BBC Two at 23:00.Who will win the Champions League?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, This is the 71st edition of Europe's elite club competition and the 34th since it was renamed the Champions League in 1992. Paris St-Germain won last season's tournament - the first to be held using a new expanded format with a 36-team league phaseBBC's chief football writer Phil McNulty: My pick to win it are Liverpool, purely on the basis of the huge strengthening they have carried out this summer. Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak are two high-class players who are Champions League-ready.The vagaries of the new league system last season saw Liverpool meet eventual winners PSG in the last 16, where they lost on penalties at Anfield.If Liverpool reach the knockout phase, which they surely will, then the Anfield factor grows with every game.PSG will be the big danger once again, a superb side who deserve the status as the best team in Europe, while Real Madrid come into every Champions League conversation as potential winners.BBC's senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel: I'm going for Liverpool. Four wins from four in the Premier League and they haven't even nearly hit top gear yet. Oh, and Isak is waiting in the wings. Arne Slot's side are the team to beat.Former Germany midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger: Real are usually the club with the strongest mentality in this competition, but PSG have to be one of the favourites and Liverpool are too, given that they had such a good Premier League season then invested so much in their squad.Those two teams come immediately to mind when I think about who will play in the final, and if I have to pick one to win it then I will go with Liverpool. Their squad depth is excellent, the quality was already there and now they have got Isak up front as well.BBC Radio 5 Live football correspondent John Murray: When a team wins Europe's richest league at a comparative canter then spends the best part of half a billion pounds on new players, while at the same time securing the services of two of the club's greatest servants, it's difficult to tip anyone other than Liverpool.Last season they lost out only narrowly to the eventual winners in a penalty shootout. It would be a tremendous prospect if this season Liverpool and PSG were to make it all the way to the final in Budapest.Match of the Day commentator Steve Wilson: Tipping Real Madrid to win the Champions League is hardly the work of a soothsayer, but you are not likely to be far wrong. I thought Xabi Alonso did some interesting things with his squad in the Club World Cup - and getting Arda Guler more involved can only be a good thing. His progress was held back by the affection everyone at the Bernabeu had for Luka Modric, now he has licence to really spread his wings.The Observer football correspondent Rory Smith: It's been a frankly unacceptable one season since Real Madrid won the trophy the club sees as its birthright, and Alonso's main task as manager is to put that right. Real are never the most coherent team in Europe, but they have more individual talent than anyone, and often that is what matters.Former England captain Steph Houghton: I am backing PSG to win it again. They are a young squad that has experienced winning already, plus they are athletic and forward thinking.Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin: For a change, I went with my head over my heart. I love PSG and the way they play, and the way they have changed the way football is being played now with their attacking attitude. I also love that they love their wingers!Spanish football expert Guillem Balague: I feel PSG have started a new era of success that has to do with using cleverly the predominant model of our times - positional football - mixed with quality, clear leadership and top players in each position. Barcelona will be close, but I'm not sure they will sort out their defensive deficiencies.BBC Champions League analyst Stephen Warnock: I think Barcelona will win it - and I am going with Lamine Yamal to be the tournament's star player.Former Arsenal defender Matt Upson: I have gone for Barcelona, who are a young team that have grown from the experience of their cracking run to the semi-finals last season.They were very unlucky not to make the final, and played brilliantly against Inter Milan - they just got exposed by a really rigid Inter team that had a way of playing and did what it said on the tin. But Barca will have learned from that.The club appears a little bit unstable off the pitch at the moment but on it they have a nice balance of special young talent and know-how - with the likes of Robert Lewandowski to come on and impact games.<div class=\"ssrcss-1spmd9u-ErrorMessage eitf6462\"><div class=\"ssrcss-s2eija-StyledInnerContainer eitf6461\"><h2 type=\"normal\" class=\"ssrcss-ad2rmd-Heading e10rt3ze0\">To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This video can not be played</p></div></div>Media caption, Paris St-Germain trophy parade along the Champs-ElyseesItalian football expert Nicky Bandini: I'll go with Liverpool. Predicting these things at the start is always a bit of guesswork - winning the Champions League comes down to fitness and form in key moments. PSG only took four points from their first five group games last season, then became a juggernaut by the spring.But Liverpool were good enough to have won it last season - PSG needed a shootout to beat them after all - and spent almost half a billion pounds strengthening again. Hugo Ekitike, Wirtz, Isak - these are all players who can decide games when it matters. They also weren't involved in the Club World Cup over the summer. We're already seeing fatigue and injury catch up to some who were, so I think that may be a factor this season.Former Arsenal forward Theo Walcott: I am not just saying this because I am Arsenal, but I do feel that if they had someone like Viktor Gyokeres in the PSG semi-final they lost last season, then they would have won it. When you create danger and put a ball into certain areas, Gyokeres is going to be there. He is that kind of old-school centre-forward that is going to make a difference for them in a lot of games this season. Arsenal are not going to draw as many games in the Premier League, and he is so equipped for the Champions League knockout ties as well.Add that to the personnel that Arsenal already have, and how strong they are defensively, and that's why I am backing them to win it.BBC Champions League analyst Nedum Onuoha: It's tough to bet against Real Madrid. Last year was one of the worst displays we have seen from them in this competition and they still made it to the knockout stage. Alonso has come in with a new structure, and their new signings will make a difference for them.AI and Opta's 'Supercomputer': We also asked AI's opinion on who will win the Champions League, and included the calculations that Opta's 'Supercomputer' came up with too.The AI prediction was generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict the Champions League winners for the 2025-26 season' and it went for Liverpool.Opta's 'Supercomputer' is actually a complex algorithm that uses a model based on betting market odds and the sports analytics company's own 'Power Rankings', which are calculated using past results.It has simulated the 2025-26 competition 10,000 times and makes Liverpool favourites, with a 20.4% chance of winning, followed by Arsenal (16%), PSG (12.1%) and Manchester City and Barcelona (both 8.4%).Disagree with our expert humans or think you know more than any machine?

Champions League?Liverpool (7)AI, Nicky Bandini,Thomas Hitzlsperger,Phil McNulty, Sami Mokbel,John Murray& Opta's 'Supercomputer'Paris St-Germain (3)Guillem Balague, Steph Houghton& Pat NevinReal Madrid (3)Nedum Onuoha, Rory Smith& Steve WilsonBarcelona (2)Matt Upson & Stephen WarnockArsenal (1)Theo WalcottSource: BBCWhich English club will go furthest?Phil McNulty: See my first answer, although I do think Arsenal and Manchester City have the capability to go deep into the competition as well as Liverpool. The Gunners reached the semi-final last season and have made serious moves this summer, so they will have high hopes.Nicky Bandini: I've picked them to win it, so it has to be Liverpool! But many of the things I said about them could also be argued for Arsenal - a huge investment in an already top-class squad that wasn't so far off last time around. Really, all the English clubs ought to be capable of a deep run, given their resources. Premier League clubs spent more on transfers this summer than those from La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1 and the Bundesliga combined.Rory Smith: I'll go for Manchester City on the grounds that I think Arsenal will, come April, get distracted by their (eventually successful) pursuit of the Premier League title. I'd expect all six English teams will make the knockout rounds - and two or three to make the semi-finals - but Pep Guardiola will push particularly hard: Europe may well be his best chance of a major trophy.Theo Walcott: I think all six English teams will do well, not just Arsenal. I only maybe look at Newcastle and think they may not have the strength in depth for this competition, but they should still make the knockout stages.Nedum Onuoha: Having six of them in there, who are capable of beating anyone, is going to be interesting. In terms of who will go furthest, I feel like Liverpool, City and Arsenal's chances are pretty similar. So, apologies to my City folk but I went back to last season and which team went the furthest.That was Arsenal - and that semi-final defeat to PSG they felt so disappointed about. With the players they have brought in this summer, they are capable of going one step further and reaching the final this time.<div class=\"ssrcss-1spmd9u-ErrorMessage eitf6462\"><div class=\"ssrcss-s2eija-StyledInnerContainer eitf6461\"><h2 type=\"normal\" class=\"ssrcss-ad2rmd-Heading e10rt3ze0\">To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This video can not be played</p></div></div>Media caption, No better team in competition than Arsenal - Arteta after Champions League exit against PSGSami Mokbel: Liverpool for all the reasons I've already mentioned. But, away from the Merseysiders, Arsenal look well-equipped to go deep into the competition. Their squad is among the strongest in European football.Steve Wilson: I like the look of Chelsea, but obviously Liverpool will strongly fancy their chances.Stephen Warnock: Chelsea are my surprise package, but Liverpool will go the furthest of the Premier League sides.Steph Houghton: I see Liverpool as having the squad depth to be able to compete in all competitions. Their signings have added real quality to an already strong squad.Matt Upson: For similar reasons to why I think Barca will win it, I think Arsenal will do the best of the English teams. The core of their team is still together, they have strengthened their squad and they are also another big European campaign further along. They can use a run like the one they had last season in order to be even more successful.Pat Nevin: I am certain Arsenal have got that depth you need to go far in this competition.Chelsea have got a good chance of improving again but Arsenal, with their squad and especially when they get everyone back fit, will absolutely be able to manage.Guillem Balague: I think Chelsea are creating something special. Remember when their fans were moaning about the team?The hardest thing is to see the bigger picture when you are a fan, but Chelsea have got youth, direction, a fantastic manager, ambition and order - in the same positional football PSG are so good at. Love their journey to the top.Who will be the surprise package?<div class=\"ssrcss-1spmd9u-ErrorMessage eitf6462\"><div class=\"ssrcss-s2eija-StyledInnerContainer eitf6461\"><h2 type=\"normal\" class=\"ssrcss-ad2rmd-Heading e10rt3ze0\">To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This video can not be played</p></div></div>Media caption, A 'new era' of the Champions League - all you need to knowThomas Hitzlsperger: I've got two teams I'd like to mention here.The first is Athletic Bilbao, who are a team I've been watching a lot and a unique club that I really admire. They are back in the Champions League for the first time since 2015 and their manager Ernesto Valverde has done a phenomenal job. They are a solid side, who have made a very good start to the new season.The other team, Bodo/Glimt, have been one of my favourites for years and they have now finally qualified for the Champions League. People probably don't appreciate enough what they have achieved, even though they saw them reach the Europa League semi-finals when they played Tottenham last season. It's one of the best stories in modern football.Juventus and Manchester City both have to go to Norway to play them, in November and January, and they will definitely not be looking forward to those games.<div class=\"ssrcss-1spmd9u-ErrorMessage eitf6462\"><div class=\"ssrcss-s2eija-StyledInnerContainer eitf6461\"><h2 type=\"normal\" class=\"ssrcss-ad2rmd-Heading e10rt3ze0\">To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This video can not be played</p></div></div>Media caption, 'Spurs are afraid and they should be' Bodo fans confident in the ArcticSteve Wilson: I'm not sure a club with their pedigree can be labelled a 'surprise package' exactly, but I have a real soft spot for Juventus, so I want them to do really well.Nicky Bandini: Maybe Galatasaray. They have put together an astonishingly talented squad these last couple of years. I continue to think Victor Osimhen is one of the best number nines on the planet, so upgrading his loan into a permanent move was a coup, then on top of that they added Leroy Sane this summer, as well as Ilkay Gundogan and Wilfried Singo, who has had a solid couple of seasons at Monaco.You could even throw Mauro Icardi into the mix as the cliched 'like a new signing' if he ever gets back to his best after the cruciate ligament injury he suffered last season. There's a lot for manager Okan Buruk to work with.John Murray: How about the Italian champions Napoli as the surprise package? Always difficult to beat in Naples, now with the added nous of Kevin de Bruyne to add to the wily ways of coach Antonio Conte.Steph Houghton: De Bruyne brings class, experience and something special to Napoli. Not many other players have what he has. He has a chance to win it with his new team.Theo Walcott: Bayern Munich will do well but I know I can't class them as a surprise package because they are expecting to win it. I'm going for Napoli, because of what De Bruyne brings to the table. Phil McNulty: The usual suspects will be involved, but any side coached by Conte will be well organised and a formidable opponent, so I will go with Napoli.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Antonio Conte won Serie A for the fifth time as a manager last season - his first success with Napoli after lifting the title three times with Juventus and once with InterSami Mokbel: Under Conte, Napoli have thrived. They won the Serie A title in his first season in charge and have three from three this season. And with De Bruyne in tow...Rory Smith: There are no surprises in European football any more - the big clubs have spent the better part of 30 years killing them off. I think Qarabag will be better than many expect, based on their Europa League form last year, and Galatasaray and Athletic Bilbao might offer a bit of variety in the last 16. But in terms of actually progressing into the latter stages, it has to be Napoli, given the depth of squad Conte has built. Yep, that's right: this year's dark horses are... the champions of Italy.Pat Nevin: They are a pot three team and they have never been to the Champions League semi-final, and I think they can get there... so that makes Napoli a surprise package even though I admit it's a bit of a cheat.Matt Upson: I suppose Napoli are a surprise on this stage - while they are flying in Serie A, if they did well in the Champions League it would probably come as more of shock than if Inter or Juve did, even though Napoli are probably the better team.Nedum Onuoha: This is a bit of a paradox in some ways because they are in pot one, but I think Chelsea are very capable of beating absolutely anyone.They are Club World Cup champions - I know some people want to disregard that title but most people thought that PSG side were unbeatable, so I'll give Chelsea some credit there.Guillem Balague: Watch out for Villarreal. They are solid, have signed players that will have to show their worth, but they have spent more than ever. Marcelino Garcia Toral is one of the top managers in Europe - have a look at his career - and offers physicality, order and quality upfront - the type of qualities that can take them far.Which player are you most looking forward to watching?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Williams scored the opening goal in the Euro 2024 final when Spain beat England 2-1 in BerlinRory Smith: The fact the younger Williams brother, Nico, is still at Athletic Bilbao is down, more than anything, to Barcelona's ongoing financial malaise, but it is the sort of thing that should be celebrated. He signed a 10-year deal this summer, and he will want to prove he can cut it on the biggest club stage. I'd mention Edon Zhegrova at Juventus, too, another edge-of-your-seat winger, but having two is cheating.Guillem Balague: Desire Doue (PSG), Lamine Yamal (Barcelona), Joao Pedro (Chelsea), Tajon Buchanan (Villarreal), Arda Guler and Kylian Mbappe (both Real Madrid)... do I have to chose just the one? This is a competition full of interest and quality. The toughest one to win.Pat Nevin: Estevao Willian has got every chance of being one of the best in the business.Nedum Onuoha: I wanted to go for Estevao but Pat Nevin took him first... so I have gone more defensive minded, and I've picked Dean Huijsen.If Real Madrid are going to win the Champions League this year, it's going to come down to that big defender doing well for them, because a Xabi Alonso team is built on that strong defensive foundation, and I think Huijsen is going to be the star.Theo Walcott: I am really looking forward to seeing Arsenal's Eberechi Eze in the Champions League.It's very different to Premier League football and there might be games where he gets a bit more time on the ball. When you give that time to a player like him, who is so gifted, it is exciting to think what he could do.If I had to pick a player from outside the Premier League then it would have to be Yamal, because I don't see a lot of him. With Eze, I know what he can do and I want him to show everyone on this kind of stage.Phil McNulty: It's not a shock choice but I can't wait to see Yamal play for Barcelona, hopefully starting against Newcastle on Thursday, although the 18-year-old is struggling with a back injury picked up on international duty with Spain.PSG's Doue is another brilliant young talent currently struggling with an injury, but he is another who will light up the tournament when fit, as he did so wonderfully last season.Matt Upson: Yamal is the player I want to see. He is a ridiculous talent and I love watching him play.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Yamal's first goal for Barcelona in the first leg of their semi-final against Inter made him the youngest scorer in a Champions League semi-final - aged 17 years and 291 days - breaking Kylian Mbappe's record of 18 years and 140 days set in 2017John Murray: The player I'm looking forward to watching is Yamal as I am yet to commentate on him in a Barcelona shirt. While disappointingly it looks like he might not be fit for Thursday at St James' Park, I suspect there will be other opportunities as this Champions League progresses.Sami Mokbel: At 18, Yamal is still a kid - but already one of the premier attacking talents in European football. Destined to be one of, if not the, best footballers in the world.Steph Houghton: Yamal is a global superstar. I'm excited to see how he performs against teams that are more than likely going to double up against him.Nicky Bandini: We're all itching to see more of Yamal, aren't we? The two legs of Barcelona's semi-final against Inter last season will stay with me for a very long time. Maybe it's unfair to ask an 18-year-old what he can do for an encore, but you can't help but be excited at the prospect.There are plenty of others I'm excited to watch too though! Of course we're all curious about Max Dowman after he made his debut for Arsenal at 15, and it'll be fun to see Scott McTominay in the Champions League with Napoli after he fired them to a domestic title last season and was named  Serie A's Most Valuable Player. I wonder if this might be a breakout year for Kenan Yildiz too, still only 20 and with a full season of starting for Juventus now under his belt.<div class=\"ssrcss-1spmd9u-ErrorMessage eitf6462\"><div class=\"ssrcss-s2eija-StyledInnerContainer eitf6461\"><h2 type=\"normal\" class=\"ssrcss-ad2rmd-Heading e10rt3ze0\">To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This video can not be played</p></div></div>Media caption, 'The Premier League was quite hard, I had to go off with cramps' - WoltemadeSteve Wilson: Nick Woltemade was left out of Stuttgart's Champions League squad last season, so will presumably make his debut in the competition when Newcastle play Barca on matchday one. Memories of Tino Asprilla, anyone?Thomas Hitzlsperger: It's probably not the most obvious choice, but I am going for Woltemade. There has been so much talk about him for a while - maybe not in England until Newcastle signed him for £69m, but definitely in Germany.Bayern Munich wanted to sign him in the summer but Stuttgart would not sell him for the money they were offering. Bayern president Uli Hoeness says Woltemade is not worth what Newcastle paid for him, but the big price tag is not his fault.Woltemade has just helped Stuttgart win the German Cup and he has got something about him. He seems a very down-to-earth guy who you want to do well and I hope his ability will shine through in the Premier League as well as the Champions League.So, what do you think?What information do we collect from this quiz?Related topicsLiverpoolNapoliBarcelonaParis St-GermainChelseaManchester CityReal MadridTottenham HotspurArsenalUEFA Champions LeagueNewcastle UnitedFootballMore on this storyListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 August"

    "content": "Vegas nights with 'Rocky' Hatton's Mancunian armyImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Hatton's legendary fights in Las Vegas in the late 2000s meant a great deal to devoted fans who followed him there from Manchester and beyondByDaniel AustinBBC Sport senior journalistPublished20 minutes agoOnce Ricky Hatton rose to the elite ranks of international boxing, sweeping up titles with his exhilarating, all-action fighting style, there was only one place to go next – the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.From 2007 to 2009, thousands of Mancunians and fans from across the UK followed Hatton to Sin City's famous Strip to throw their support behind a boxer they lauded as the sport's 'people's champion'.Hatton fought three times in arguably the sport's most prestigious venue, with each 10,000-mile round trip creating indelible memories.His death at the age of 46 was announced on Sunday, and BBC Sport has spoken to some of those who travelled to Nevada to understand what it was about him that attracted such a devoted, adoring band of supporters.'There is, and always will be, only one Ricky Hatton'Published1 day agoHatton's 'heart as big as his smile' says familyPublished7 hours agoFormer world champion Hatton dies aged 46Published1 day agoA working-class fighter who grew up above a pub on a council estate and worked for a time in the family carpet business, Hatton's modest background and humble, good-natured personality endeared him to a hardcore set of fans from the very start of his career.\"When Ricky came along, we immediately felt like we had a connection with him, because he was so down to earth, so open and honest\", says Jamie Hind, a 47-year-old fan who lived in Cheshire and Manchester during Hatton's career.\"You just felt like he you knew him and couldn't help but be carried on the wave of enthusiasm for him.\"Me and my pals were fortunate enough to see him fight a fair few times. We always made sure to make a proper night of it whenever he was fighting, and he gave us some great memories.\"Hatton built up a stellar record in the light-welterweight ranks, winning 41 consecutive fights in a career that began in 1997 in Widnes, and the bright lights of America were irresistible.Hatton fought and beat Colombia's Juan Urango and Mexican Jose Luis Castillo in Paradise, the neighbourhood that contains many of the famous Vegas tourist hotspots.His reputation as a star attraction in Nevada was growing, as was his fanbase.Armed with a 43-0 record, Hatton challenged global superstar Floyd Mayweather for his welterweight belts in 2007, this time at the MGM Grand.This was in an era before Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury headlined stadiums.It was Hatton's time, and it was witnessed by Hatton's people. Many planeloads of them.A pre-fight weigh-in was attended by over 5,000 people, many of them travelling Hatton fans who serenaded him with chants of \"Walking in a Hatton wonderland\" while relentlessly booing pound-for-pound all-time great Mayweather.Hatton was a Manchester City supporter, but he united Mancunians.\"I've never seen anything like that weigh-in,\" says Sean McManamon, a fan from Urmston who attended the Mayweather fight with his father and a friend.\"The Americans were stunned by the amount of people and the noise. It was deafening.\"We paid about £700 for tickets to the fight - they were right at the back, but we just had to be there.\"Ricky was a proper Mancunian. We're big United fans, but you put your football allegiance aside for Ricky Hatton.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Before the Malignaggi fight in 2008, Hatton's belts were brought into the ring by Liam and Noel Gallagher of OasisA raucous crowd sang Hatton's name throughout the fight, but their hero was defeated by knockout in the 10th round. He claimed to have lost concentration after being infuriated by the referee's decision to deduct a point from his score in round six.But the thousands who followed Hatton across the Atlantic were proud to have done so, and the contrast between the rugged Hatton and the pristine Mayweather drew in new fans.\"Thousands of us just descended on Vegas,\" says 45-year-old James Corcoran, a Hatton fan who hosts the Oasis Podcast and travelled for the Mayweather contest.\"The atmosphere was electric - everywhere you went, all you heard was 'One Ricky Hatton' being sung. Everyone loved him.\"Mayweather was American and the number one boxer in the world. But Ricky really connected with people there - there were lots of Americans supporting him.\"We're all often drawn to the athletes who aren't the polished, consummate professionals but feel more like someone you could have bumped into in the pub the night before.\"That's who he was. It's like the British Rocky story.\"Hatton's next assignment was a May 2008 homecoming fight against Juan Lazcano, winning on points in front of 55,000 at the home of his beloved Manchester City.That earned him a return to the MGM Grand six months later to defend his light-welterweight belts, and this time Hatton won big in Vegas, defeating the Italian-American Paulie Malignaggi whose corner threw in the towel in the 11th round.Before the fight, so many travelling fans from the North West had made the trip that a beaming Hatton took part in a photo shoot in which he held up transparent bags full of tickets.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ricky Hatton's popularity drew thousands of fans from Manchester to Las Vegas, despite the high cost of flights, tickets and accommodation\"I went to the Malignaggi fight with a few of my mates,\" says Jamie Hind. \"It was an incredible experience being out there with all of the other fans from the North West who had come over.\"When it's somebody that you feel you have a real affinity with, heading to Vegas to back him just felt like it was an opportunity too good to miss, one of the best things you could do with your life.\"A final return to Vegas came in 2009, when Hatton went head to head with Manny Pacquiao. The Filipino had already won titles in five different divisions and was too strong for Hatton, knocking him out in the second round.It turned out to be the penultimate fight of Hatton's professional career, and the last in Vegas.But the Stateside legacy that Hatton left, and the experiences he gave to the fans who travelled so far to cheer him on alongside their loved ones, will be cherished long after his untimely death.\"We still talk about going over there to follow him now,\" McManamon says.\"I don't see my mate who I went to the Mayweather fight with that much any more, but last time I did we spent ages talking about what a privilege it was to go and see Ricky fight there.\"Anyone who went to one of those fights will never forget it. He typified that Mancunian heart and sense of humour.\"He was one of the lads. That's why people loved him so much.\"Related topicsBoxingMore on this story'Etched into British sporting folklore' - Hatton's life in picturesPublished1 day agoHatton's death is 'heartbreaking' - RooneyPublished1 day ago"

Duplantis clears 6.30m to break world recordByHarry PooleBBC Sport journalist in TokyoPublished15 September 2025610 CommentsHistory-maker Armand Duplantis soared to his 14th world record with his final attempt as the Swedish superstar continued his pole vault domination by winning a third consecutive world title.A captivated audience in Tokyo remained in the stadium long after Monday night's other events had concluded to watch the sport's modern-day great become the first human to clear the 6.30m barrier.The 25-year-old has now claimed the past eight global men's pole vault gold medals on offer across both indoor and outdoor competitions following this triumph in the Japanese capital.Returning to the stadium where he achieved the first of those major successes four years ago, Duplantis owned his latest moment in the spotlight with his charisma and breathtaking talent.Back yard to brilliant - the making of Duplantis, and how high can he go?How much does Duplantis get for breaking world record?Published14 hours ago'Prepare for a battle' - Kerr warns 1500m rivalsPublished11 hours agoThe two-time Olympic champion sealed gold with a first-time clearance at 6.15m to end Emmanouil Karalis' admirable challenge - and then raised the bar to one centimetre higher than he had ever gone before.Such is the respect from his competitors, the Greek runner-up - who has risen to fourth on the discipline's all-time list amid his pursuit of Duplantis - held a fan for his rival between his agonisingly close first and second attempts.With all eyes fixed upon him, a hush of expectation was replaced by rhythmic applause upon Duplantis' request as he prepared for his final attempt. Japan's National Stadium then erupted as he leapt up from the mat after his successful effort and began his celebrations.\"It's better than I could have imagined. To give you guys this world record is amazing. I'm just so happy,\" Duplantis told the crowd, who had stayed beyond 23:00 local time to watch him seek the record.A fourth world record of 2025 by Duplantis is the most number of times he has improved the mark during a single year in his career, which seemingly continues with no limit in sight.Australia's bronze medallist Kurtis Marschall: \"It was an amazing night, the fans were fantastic. \"Mondo is from another planet - he is doing incredible things, things many people thought were impossible.\"I can't wait to see what he's got in the future.\"A $100,000 incentive - but how high can he go?Duplantis, widely known by his nickname 'Mondo', made clear his intentions upon reaching the final. While he knew he had work to do to capture the gold, the world record was \"on the cards\" in the showpiece.Everybody else had already made that assumption.World record talk has replaced any discussion of the destination of men's pole vault gold medals since he first succeeded Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie as the world record holder by clearing 6.17m in February 2020.And, with World Athletics offering a $100,000 world record bonus, on top of the $70,000 awarded to gold medallists at the championship, there was no lack of motivation to deliver in front of another expectant global audience.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Armand Duplantis has won 12 senior international titles Duplantis has already won every major gold available to him, while last year he became the first man to retain the Olympic pole vault title for 68 years at Paris 2024.Now it is a case of how many he will end up with - and, perhaps more pertinently, how high he can go.\"No-one knows Duplantis' limits. He is hitting big heights in training but who knows how high he will go? There are a few years of world records in him, for sure,\" former Olympic heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill said on BBC TV.\"Moments like this take your breath away. When you think about how much pressure he was under... He is phenomenal and is setting the future of this sport.\"The speed and athletic ability that this requires - there are so many elements. This is such a hard event to master.\"How Duplantis came to dominateDuplantis surpassed a record-extending 100 career clearances over six metres in winning his third world indoor title in March.For context, it is a height that has been cleared by just 28 other people throughout history.Duplantis' closest challenger this season has been Karalis, who despite improving his personal best to 6.08m, trails 22 centimetres behind. Victory in Japan extends his unbeaten streak to 37 competitions, stretching back to July 2023.The US-born Swede, who chose to represent his mother's homeland, has not lost a major final since Doha in 2019, where as a teenager he missed out to American Sam Kendricks on countback. How has he done it? A potent combination of lightning runway speed, technical precision in the take-off, explosive power and the bravery to embrace it as he travels far beyond the average height of a giraffe (5.5m).It is his sprinting prowess in particular that his rivals pinpoint as a defining factor, with the higher approach speed generating greater kinetic energy and creating the foundation for greater heights.That is something he has enhanced through specially-developed sprinting spikes.Recap day three of World Athletics Championships as champion Duplantis breaks recordCaudery suffers injury heartbreak in TokyoPublished22 hours agoWorld Athletics medal table - and what's on Tuesday?Published12 hours agoHis incremental centimetre-by-centimetre approach to improving the world record is by no means revolutionary; since Sergey Bubka became the first person to clear six metres 40 years ago, the record has been nudged no more than two centimetres higher at a time.It helped that Duplantis grew up with a pole vault pit in the back garden of his childhood home in Louisiana, with his father Greg a former elite competitor in the discipline.That upbringing has also inspired his younger sister Johanna to pursue a future in the sport, the 22-year-old turning professional earlier this year, and Duplantis is still coached by his parents.The record-breaking dominance he has gone on to achieve has transcended the sport and established Duplantis as the sport's biggest star.With more than two million followers across his social media accounts, he has been at the forefront of promoting World Athletics' new global event, the Ultimate Championship.That is set to take place for the first time in Budapest next year to bridge the gap between global competitions, while Duplantis is poised to remain the face of the sport for many years to come.\"We used to say that we needed Usain Bolt here to bring some interest to athletics. Duplantis is a superstar and is transcending the sport,\" said former world 1500m champion Steve Cram. \"Pole vault draws you in, and that is why Armand is a showman. He orchestrates it. \"It is great for the sport and long may he go higher.\"Duplantis' world record progress6.17m – 8 Feb 2020 (Torun, Poland)6.18m – 15 Feb 2020 (Glasgow, UK)6.19m - 7 Mar 2022 (Belgrade, Serbia)6.20m – 20 Mar 2022 (Belgrade, Serbia)6.21m – 24 Jul 2022 (Eugene, USA)6.22m – 25 Feb 2023 (Clermont-Ferrand, France)6.23m – 17 Sept 2023 (Eugene, USA)6.24m – 20 Apr 2024 (Xiamen, China)6.25m – 5 Aug 2024 (Paris, France)6.26m – 25 Aug 2024 (Chorzow, Poland)6.27m – 28 Feb 2025 (Clermont-Ferrand, France)6.28m – 15 Jun 2025 (Stockholm, Sweden)6.29m – 12 Aug 2025 (Budapest, Hungary)6.30m – 15 Sept 2025 (Tokyo, Japan)Related topicsAthletics"

    "content": "Cramp cocktails and apps - how rugby tracks 'fifth vital sign'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Erica Jarrell-Searcy went to Harvard University and studied molecular and cellular biologyByGrace WheelerBBC SportPublished12 minutes agoIf you scan the drinks menu at your local bar, you're very unlikely to see 'Sylvia's Cramp Cocktail'.But if you're Erica Jarrell-Searcy from the USA women's rugby team and you're on your period, you might want to order one.This is among the ways teams have been trying to ensure their players are able to perform at the highest level throughout their menstrual cycle.As the Women's Rugby World Cup takes place over five weeks, the female athletes that reach the final will have competed while managing one or two menstrual cycles.From encouraging players to fill out daily questionnaires to logging their cycles in an app, BBC Sport looks at how rugby has been tracking periods and why?Why track periods?Period symptoms such as fatigue, cramps, hormonal fluctuations, and digestive issues can have an impact on strength, endurance, focus and recovery.According to the BBC's Elite British Sportswomen's Study 2024, 88 out of the 143 athletes who responded said their performance had been affected by their period, while the same number missed training or a competition because of it.By keeping track of a player's menstrual cycle, teams can make adaptations to training or nutrition if necessary and it is also a key indicator of overall health.\"A lot of people describe our cycle or our period as the fifth vital sign of a female,\" said Abi Okell, a former player and now lead rugby physio of Sale Sharks Women.The other four vital signs for a female are temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate.\"If you know you're having a regular menstrual cycle, then essentially you are healthy, your body is willing to be able to procreate because it knows you can grow a human,\" added Okell.\"The main things that we look for is that they are tracking day one of their bleed.\"Okell said she prefers players not to use contraception that takes away a natural period, such as the contraceptive pill, because players lose the fifth vital sign as they are getting a withdrawal bleed, rather than a menstrual period.'Peeing on sticks' and wellness formsEngland winger Abby Dow said her team normally sit down once or twice a year to discuss periods, especially when they have a big tournament, or when new players join the squad.\"Rugby as a sport isn't going to wait for you if you are on your period and no-one is going to tackle you easier because you are bleeding,\" the 27-year-old told BBC Sport.\"We recap and talk about how we handle it (a period) as an England team and what we can expect.\"The talk will normally be broken up into the stages of the cycle and our physios and doctors will go through and explain what physical symptoms we could be feeling.\"There are four main stages of a menstrual cycle; menstrual phase (period), the follicular phase (egg follicle growth), ovulation (egg release), and the luteal phase (preparation for pregnancy). England's Red Roses also have a wellness monitoring form that players are encouraged to fill in and Dow added: \"I think a lot of us also personally track.\"We also went through a stage of having ovulation tests, so we were peeing on sticks to work out how consistent our ovulation is.\"In her team, USA second row Jerrell-Searcy said: \"Every morning you fill out a form saying, 'I'm this sore, I'm in a great mood or a bad mood'.\"A saliva test is also a reliable way to show a rise in oestrogen levels, which happens before ovulation. This is vital sign to show a women's body is healthy.Other teams adopt different tracking methods, with Wales using Vodafone's Connect app which has GPS trackers - placed in the players' shirts - combined with data collected on their performance, menstrual cycle phases and mental and physical wellbeing.Their players also get daily monitoring questions on the app.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Dow made her debut for England in 2017 and scored five tries in her first two games'Cocktails' and adjustments in gym - how data is usedAfter the physios and doctors have looked at the data, adaptations can be made in training, which could include a reduction of intensity, taking out extra conditioning or in a lot of cases adding extra mobility sessions in the warm-up.\"It's about working out how can we maximise ourselves and when you are not feeling so great [bleeding], how can we adjust things like the gym to suit you,\" explained Dow.\"You are not going to get PBs [personal bests] and that is OK.\"The coaches are not going to go, 'can you push?', because we know that that isn't going to happen and that isn't something to be frowned upon.\"Jarrell-Searcy, 26, said her team's coaches are \"very careful with our numbers and pushing into what they call, the red zone\".The red zone can be seen where a player is in a state where they are fatigued and more at risk of injury through tiredness.\"It's cycle informed, but it's not as cycle mediated,\" added Jarrell-Searcy.This means the menstrual cycle doesn't control what adaptations are made, it just influences decisions made by the professionals.The menstrual cycle is personal, so often the physios will monitor the player during the sessions and games, but it is unlikely they will sit out training or a game.\"The perception of a period can take over, but when the players have their rugby head on, they tend to be focused and pretty involved,\" said Okell.Regardless of periods, Jarrell-Searcy added the game schedule stayed the same and a bleed was \"not going to make or break you as an athlete\".There are other things to aid players during stages of their menstrual cycle.Clubs have nutritionists who can use the tracking data from players to help prepare the body for the bleed and ensure they get enough nutrients before, during and after sessions.For example, an athlete will eat more carbohydrates to give them the energy stores they need.\"Some athletes will have a heavier bleed than others and we have to look at whether they will need some medical intervention in terms of adding in tablets.\" added Okell.This would give athletes more vitamins and minerals they might lose during a bleed.She added: \"We're not men's athletes, so we need to more so than just 40g of protein a day every day.\"\"It's not like this like 24-hour cycle that they (men) get to have,\" said Jarell-Searcy. \"We do need to be aware that you have to increase your intake of certain things and your behaviour around recovery to accommodate your hormonal fluctuations.\"Players also take things to try to minimise the pain of cramping in the stomach so they can continue to perform.This includes 'Sylvia's Cramp Cocktail' - named after a former member of the USA medical and physio team - which is a mixture of vitamins and minerals designed to replace those lost during a bleed.\"You just take it and then tough it out for the the next 20 minutes until it kicks in and then you're OK to train,\" revealed Jarrell-Searcy.Why Irish women's teams are ditching white shortsPublished1 February 2023Is there a link between injury and periods?No research shows there is any particular time a player is more at risk of injury during the menstrual cycle.\"We can injure ourselves on every day of the menstrual cycle,\" said Okell.\"It's really hard to say that players are getting injured in the phases without the specific hormonal testing.\"According to a study conducted by the National Library of Medicine, 'a causal relationship has not yet been established', to whether a menstrual cycle is related to injuries.However, Okell said there may be a link between injury and the lack of confidence to move freely for fear of leaking on their shorts.She explained players \"change their movement patterns and the way they do things that can potentially cause an injury risk\".\"We would promote this is something we don't need to be fearful [of] and hold yourself back or not do a particular training,\" added Okell.Related topicsRugby UnionMore on this storyWho plays who in Rugby World Cup quarter-finals?Published1 day agoListen to the latest Rugby Union Weekly podcastCan England captain Williamson play piano with a professional orchestra?

I thought all summer the absolute priority was a centre midfield player with legs, who can play and can control a game.\"Goalkeeper was [also] a major issue. Did they really need to get to the Grimsby game to realise [Andre] Onana is not good enough?\"If Manchester United were not in the market for Gianluigi Donnarumma when he became available, that is criminal offence.\"The recruitment side went to buy forwards. That did need addressing, but did it need three of them? I'm not sure it did.\"Man Utd have 'got worse' under Amorim - RooneyPublished23 hours agoFor a different philosophy, you have to change the man - AmorimPublished1 day agoWhere the Manchester derby was won and lost - tactical analysisPublished15 hours ago'He cannot carry on playing this way'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ruben Amorim continues to be supported by Manchester United officialsChelsea visit Old Trafford on Saturday. Then comes a trip to Brentford - where United have conceded four times on each of their past two visits - followed by encounters with Sunderland and then Liverpool at Anfield, making the chances of a significant upturn in fortunes in the short term unlikely.Scholes is not alone in believing United have no chance of reversing their fortunes unless Amorim changes his style, with all-time leading scorer Wayne Rooney believing his old side have \"got worse\" under the Portuguese, who replaced the sacked Erik ten Hag last November.\"He cannot carry on playing this way, he just can't,\" said Scholes, who won 11 Premier League titles and the Champions League twice in a 20-year career with the club.\"At some point there has to be a moment where he thinks, 'I have to change something because what I am doing now is not working and I am not getting results'. The proof is there.\"I like Amorim, with everything he says, he seems to be a likeable man. But unfortunately results paint a picture.\"At this moment in time it isn't good enough. At this moment in time if results don't improve, performances don't really matter that much. He has to win some games or the pressure is going to come on him massively.\"Following last season's struggles, where United finished 15th in the league and lost the Europa League final to Tottenham, Amorim worked hard in the summer trying to create a harmonious dressing room culture.While there are some within the United squad who are thought to be uneasy about the 40-year-old's refusal to change his tactics, there is no sign of widespread discontent as yet.The optimism around Amorim is not confined to the Old Trafford boardroom.Joao Noronha Lopes, favourite to win the Benfica presidential election on 25 October, is thought to be keen on bringing him back to the club where he made his name as a player, making 154 appearances across six seasons.Lopes was at Etihad Stadium for Sunday's derby, where he was accompanied by Pedro Ferreira and Nuno Gomes, the former Portugal and Benfica forward, who is one of Amorim's closest friends.Speaking to Portuguese media before the group left for Manchester, Gomes spoke about the prospect of hiring him.\"I can't answer that question,\" he said. \"Ruben Amorim is the coach of Manchester United.\"But one thing I do know, Ruben Amorim will be the coach of Benfica one day.\"<div class=\"ssrcss-1spmd9u-ErrorMessage eitf6462\"><div class=\"ssrcss-s2eija-StyledInnerContainer eitf6461\"><h2 type=\"normal\" class=\"ssrcss-ad2rmd-Heading e10rt3ze0\">To play this video you need to enable JavaScript in your browser.</h2><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">This video can not be played</p></div></div>Media caption, Mainoo doesn't have the right partner - ScholesRelated topicsManchester UnitedPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?"
