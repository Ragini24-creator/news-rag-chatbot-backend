Mandelson red flags were missed or ignored, senior Labour MP says33 minutes agoShareSaveJoshua NevettPolitical reporter andKate WhannelPolitical reporterShareSavePA MediaA senior Labour MP has said "red flags were missed or ignored" before Peter Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US, in an emergency debate about his sacking.Dame Emily Thornberry, chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said "something went very wrong" given Lord Mandelson's known links to convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein.Lord Mandelson was sacked last week after the publication of emails that showed the Labour peer had sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced jail in 2008.In the debate, the appointment was widely criticised by MPs, including Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of "hiding from questions".Badenoch said the prime minister had "shrivelled" from leadership and called on him to apologise to Epstein's victims.On Monday, Sir Keir said he would "never" have appointed Lord Mandelson if he had known the full details of his relationship with Epstein.The prime minister sacked Lord Mandelson after reviewing a cache of emails between the Labour peer and Epstein.The emails were published by Bloomberg after Sir Kier had expressed confidence in Lord Mandelson in Parliament, and the prime minister has insisted he did not know what was in the messages at that point.

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty ImagesTrump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019)There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings.Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries.How Windsor became 'Trumpton'For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents.Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor "Trumpton", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show

Teacher's fears over Southport killer met with 'red tape'2 hours agoShareSaveJonny HumphriesLiverpool ShareSaveGetty ImagesThe Southport Inquiry will examine whether any agencies "took responsibility" for managing his caseA teacher emailed her colleague in frustration at the "frightening red tape" preventing her from getting police, social services and mental health interventions for the Southport killer, a public inquiry heard. Violence-obsessed Axel Rudakubana had assaulted other children, attacked his own father and been caught carrying knives between 2019 and July 2024, when he murdered three girls at a dance studio.But different agencies - including Prevent, MI5 and social services - appeared to pass his case between them, the inquiry heard.Nicholas Moss KC, lead counsel to Southport Inquiry, said it would focus in the coming months on whether any agencies involved had "taken responsibility". Family handoutsBebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Aguiar were murdered in the attack on 29 July 2024Delivering his opening statement, Mr Moss said it was "notable" that the then 17-year-old appeared to have deliberately targeted women and girls when he chose to attack the Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.Nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Bebe King, six, were killed and eight other children and two adults were seriously wounded. The inquiry, sitting at Liverpool Town Hall, had been set up to explore the killer's history, his contact with relevant agencies and any "missed opportunities" to prevent the "manifestly and extremely cowardly" attackMr Moss said the "red tape" email was sent by Cheryl Smith, a safeguarding lead at Presfield High School in Southport, who had been trying to get the teenager to attend school for around a year.He said the school's efforts "came to a head" on 21 March 2023 when Ms Smith wrote: "The red tape is frightening – [Rudakubana] was not under the remit of the children missing education team although not seen by the school since 25 May 2022.

Content: PM orders investigation into MI5 over false evidence6 hours agoShareSaveDaniel De SimoneInvestigations correspondent ShareSaveBBCThe case centres around a BBC investigation over how an MI5 agent used his role to abuse his girlfriend The prime minister has ordered a new investigation into how MI5 gave false evidence to three courts about conversations with the BBC.Sir Keir Starmer's direction follows requests from the High Court and Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), which both rejected MI5's explanations about what happened.The case centres on a neo-Nazi state informant known as Agent X who used his MI5 role to coerce his girlfriend, whom he attacked with a machete.On Tuesday, the prime minister wrote to the Investigatory Powers Commissioner Sir Brian Leveson directing him to conduct a new inquiry.In a written statement to Parliament, Sir Keir said: "I have now issued a direction to the Commissioner to commence this investigation immediately." He said the courts "will use the outcome of this investigation to determine their next steps in relation to the case of Agent X".Sir Keir noted that the relevant courts had found that MI5's investigations into the false evidence "suffered from serious procedural deficiencies".In a letter to Sir Brian, the prime minister said the courts had "rightly expressed their displeasure at MI5 for providing this false evidence".The investigation will be led by the Deputy Investigatory Powers Commissioner, Sir John Goldring, who will be supported by a "small investigation team". Sir John oversaw the Hillsborough inquests a decade ago.MI5 agent X terrorised his partner with a macheteIn February, the BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts while defending its handling of the misogynistic MI5 agent, whom the BBC had sought to expose in a 2022 investigation.Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities
